It was published by Valve Corporation in digital form and by Electronic Arts in physical form. \n\nIts plot directly follows the first game's, taking place in the Half-Life universe. You play as Chell, a test subject in a research facility formerly ran by the company Aperture Science, but taken over by an evil AI that turned upon its creators, GladOS. After defeating GladOS at the end of the first game but failing to escape the facility, Chell is woken up from a stasis chamber by an AI personality core, Wheatley, as the unkempt complex is falling apart. As the two attempt to navigate through the ruins and escape, they stumble upon GladOS, and accidentally re-activate her...\n\nPortal 2's core mechanics are very similar to the first game's ; the player must make their way through several test chambers which involve puzzles. For this purpose, they possess a Portal Gun, a weapon capable of creating teleportation portals on white surfaces. This seemingly simple mechanic and its subtleties coupled with the many different puzzle elements that can appear in puzzles allows the game to be easy to start playing, yet still feature profound gameplay. The sequel adds several new puzzle elements, such as gel that can render surfaces bouncy or allow you to accelerate when running on them.\n\nThe game is often praised for its gameplay, its memorable dialogue and writing and its aesthetic. Both games in the series are responsible for inspiring most puzzle games succeeding them, particularly first-person puzzle games. The series, its characters and even its items such as the portal gun and the companion cube have become a cultural icon within gaming communities.\n\nPortal 2 also features a co-op mode where two players take on the roles of robots being led through tests by GladOS, as well as an in-depth level editor.",

At the beginning of the game, the player visits a town of Dirtmouth. A town built above the ruins of Hallownest.

The players have to find secrets that are scattered around the level and battle their enemies. There is a certain degree of backtracking in the game as some areas are locked until the player defeats a certain boss or picks up a specific item.

Previously being on the Caribbean, now he is coming to Panau - an island in Southeast Asia. This time, Rico has to overthrow the dictatorial regime with its leader, Pandak \"Baby\" Panay and confront his former mentor, Tom Sheldon. When Rico arrives at the island, he discovers three criminal gangs: The Roaches, The Reapers and the Ular Boys. In order to prevail, Rico has to fight all of the three fractions as well.\r\n\r\nOne of the key features of the game is speed. This game is filled with adrenaline and ways of doing things very fastly. A wide variety of vehicles such as planes, boats, cars and other. A grappling hook is also available for the player as he can make his character fly around like Spider-Man or tie enemies to each other. There is a big choice of weaponry as well - you can have a pistol, two pistols, auto-rifles or even a grenade launcher! Having an open world map provides a player with experience do whatever they please - flying around, making missions or just discovering new things on the island.",

    "description": "Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons is a story about teamwork. Having a very curious setup, the story follows two brothers on a quest. With their mother dead and father being heavily ill, the only way to save is to bring water from the Tree of Life. But on their way, they will have to challenge the world and themselves. Villages, mountains and forests, bullies, trolls and wolves will await Naiee and Naia on their journey. \r\n\r\nWith having such setup, the game found a perfect way to portray this world to the audience. The beautiful visual style and something in between adventure and a platformer make the game an exciting experience. Although that is not the most curious thing about the game. With having two brothers involved in a story, the game actually gives you an opportunity to control both of them. You can solve puzzles by simultaneously moving both of the characters. For example, one of your heroes must distract an enemy, and another is supposed to go behind. This amazing feature provides you with one of the most unique experiences as you play two characters at once.",

    "description": "As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame & breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape!\nDinosaurs, Creatures, & Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator & prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies!\nYou must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants & meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing & armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage & extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system!\nBy chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.\nPick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians & vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!\nBy bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated.\nCreate a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village!\nAll items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new \"Engrams\" to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D \"Explorer Notes\". By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose!\nEverything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted & stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!\nThe mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text & voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct & draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned.\nOn the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique 'Procedurally Generated ARKs', for infinite replayability and endless surprises.\nYou can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create!\nThe over-the-top hyper real imagery of the ARK its creatures is brought to expressive life using a highly-customized Unreal Engine 4, with fully dynamic lighting & global illumination, weather systems (rain, fog, snow, etc) & true-to-life volumetric cloud simulation, and the latest in advanced DirectX11 and DirectX12 rendering techniques.

    "description": "Crusader Kings II is a global RTS which takes place in the Middle Ages of Europe. The players will govern a house of nobility of that time, and ensure that its heritage will last for centuries. The second installment of the series fills the gap in the developer’s continuum of global strategies, allowing for lengthy grand campaigns and world conquests.\nThe main points of interest in the game are your noble house, holdings, and vassals. Players can engage in diplomacy between neighboring households, sign treaties and create a bloodline between two families, forge documents and declare wars. However, the primary competitive objective would not be conquering the world, but instead, winning the prestigious ranks and ensuring that your family will prosper.\nGameplay-wise, the mechanics revolve around interactions with your neighbors and your court. Buildings built, armies trained, but most importantly, your character should be built, too. Education, marriage, religion - everything will affect your lord-protege, and players often come up with different guides on how to achieve success without regards to the luck and skill of the player.",

This is the second title of a franchise, being preceded by Red Dead Revolver and followed by Red Dead Redemption 2 coming out in late 2018. \nWe play as John Marston who gradually takes down and take out criminals and those, who crosses his path. Among the combat mechanics, the most interesting one is \"Dead Eye\" — it allows one to point multiple targets out in slow motion and then shoot them simultaneously. \nThe game features 16-players multiplayer and cooperative and also has zombie DLC — Undead Nightmare. Additional content adds two modes to the original game: undead overrun in which you have to survive an infinite amount of zombie waves, and Land Grab in which player has to defend the particular piece of land to gain control of it.",

Most of the game has the player re-enacting Silas's presumed past, while in the present the hero is narrating his own story off-screen.

There are saloons and gold mines, stagecoaches, Indians and cowboys, sheriffs and gangs. The protagonist will escape prison, wander the Wild West, fight brigands and other enemies using a variety of late XIX century firearms, and occasionally sing country songs. Gunfights and duels are the central features of the game. There's even a Duel mode, in which the player can enter a tournament of gun duels, and the Arcade mode, in which multiple opponents attack the player.

As the players come down into the dungeons of the island, they find various loot, fight dangerous creatures, collect armor, abilities, and power-ups. Upon death, the players lose all the loot they had on them. It is possible to find a shopkeep somewhere in the dungeons to purchase new equipment or have some rest. \n\nThe game uses death as a learning experience, as it randomizes the placement of enemies, so the players can't take multiple attempts to complete a level.

However, the game portrays the events of Half-Life through the eyes of Barney Calhoun a security guard employed by Black Mesa. Till the things have gone the wrong way the protagonist was responsible for the lab equipment and personnel welfare, but after the accident, his only aim is to protect a high-ranked scientist Dr. Rosenberg. The gameplay is almost similar to the original Half-Life’s: the storyline continues by navigating through the sequence of levels. Each level consists of both combat part and solving puzzles. Although Blue Shift is an expansion to the original Half-Life, both weaponry and enemies range face no changes or additions, so players use same guns to shoot same aliens. The only new mechanics is escorting a character to a specific location.",

    "description": "Resident Evil 4 is a third-person shooter game developed by Capcom Production Studio 4 and published by Capcom. The sixth major installment in the Resident Evil series, it was originally released for the GameCube in 2005. Players control U.S. government special agent Leon S. Kennedy, who is sent on a mission to rescue the U.S. president's daughter Ashley Graham, who has been kidnapped by a cult. In a rural part of Europe, Leon fights hordes of villagers infected by a mind-controlling parasite, and reunites with the spy Ada Wong.\nDevelopment began for PlayStation 2 in 1999. Four proposed versions were discarded; the first attempt was directed by Hideki Kamiya after producer Shinji Mikami. In a departure from the fixed camera angles and slower survival horror gameplay of previous instalments, the team focused on developing more dynamic shooting action.\nResident Evil 4 was announced as a GameCube exclusive as part of the Capcom Five, but was ported to numerous formats, becoming a cross-platform hit, selling over 10 million copies across all platforms. It garnered acclaim for its narrative, gameplay, voice acting, and characters, and is often named one of the best video games, winning multiple Game of the Year awards in 2005. It influenced the evolution of the survival horror and third-person genres, popularizing the \"over-the-shoulder\" third-person view. Resident Evil 5 was released in 2009.\n\n#Gameplay\nThe player controls the protagonist, Leon S. Kennedy, from a third-person perspective. Departing significantly from the series' previous games, the gameplay focuses on action and shootouts with fewer survival horror elements. The camera is placed behind Leon and zooms in for an over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon, or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle. There is no crosshair for firearms; instead, every firearm has a laser sight. Unlike previous games where players can only shoot straight, up, or down, players have more options. For example, shots to the feet can cause enemies to stumble, and shots to the arms can make them drop their weapons. Players can also shoot down projectiles like thrown axes or scythes.\nResident Evil 4 adds context-sensitive controls. Based on the situation, players can interact with the environment: kicking down a ladder, jumping out of a window, dodging an attack or executing a \"finishing move\" on weakened enemies. There are also quick time events, in which the player must press buttons indicated on-screen to execute actions such as dodging a falling boulder or wrestling an enemy to stay alive. These are often incorporated into the game's many boss fights, in which the player must avoid instant-kill attacks.\nThe main enemies are violent villagers referred to as Los Ganados (\"The Cattle\" in Spanish). Los Ganados can dodge, wield melee and projectile weapons, and are capable of working collectively and communicating with each other.\nThe inventory system features a grid system, represented by an attaché case, that has each item take up a certain number of spaces. The case can be upgraded several times, allowing for more space. Weapons, ammunition, and healing items are kept in the case, while key items and treasures are kept in a separate menu. Items may be bought from and sold to a merchant that appears in various locations. He sells first aid sprays, weapons, allows for weapons to be upgraded and buys various treasures that Leon finds. The various weapons each have their own advantages and disadvantages.\nCapcom added content for the PlayStation 2 version, which was later incorporated into the PC and Wii releases. The largest addition is \"Separate Ways\", a minigame which focuses on Ada Wong's involvement in Resident Evil 4 and her connection to the series' villain Albert Wesker. \"Ada's Report\", a five-part documentary, analyzes Ada's relationship with Wesker and his role in the plot. Other unlockable content in all versions includes the minigames \"The Mercenaries\" and \"Assignment Ada\" (using Ada to retrieve Las Plagas samples), new costumes for Leon and Ashley, new weapons, and a cutscene browser.\n\n#Plot\nU.S. government agent Leon S. Kennedy (Paul Mercier) is on a mission to rescue Ashley Graham (Carolyn Lawrence), the U.S. President's daughter, who has been kidnapped by a mysterious cult. He travels to a nameless rural village in Spain, where he encounters a group of hostile villagers who pledge their lives to Los Illuminados, the cult that kidnapped Ashley. The villagers were once simple farmers until becoming infected by a mind-controlling parasite known as Las Plagas.\nWhile in the village, Leon is captured by its chief, Bitores Mendez, and injected with Las Plagas. He finds himself held captive with Luis Sera (Rino Romano), a former Los Illuminados researcher. The two work together to escape, but soon go their separate ways. Leon finds out Ashley is being held in a church and rescues her. They both escape from the church after Osmund Saddler (Michael Gough), leader of Los Illuminados, reveals his plan to use the plaga they injected into Ashley to manipulate her into injecting the president of the United States with a \"sample\" once she returns home, allowing Saddler to begin his conquest of the world.\nAfter killing Mendez, Leon and Ashley try to take refuge in a castle but are attacked by more Illuminados under the command of Ramon Salazar (Rene Mujica), another of Saddler's henchmen who owns the castle, and the two become separated by Salazar's traps. Meanwhile, Luis searches for pills that will slow Leon and Ashley's infection, as well as a sample of Las Plagas. He brings the two items to Leon but is killed by Saddler, who takes the sample, while the pills to suppress the infection remain in Leon's hands. While in the castle, Leon briefly encounters Ada Wong (Sally Cahill), a woman from his past who supports him during his mission. He battles his way through the castle before killing Salazar.\nAfterward, Leon travels to a nearby island research facility, where he continues the search for Ashley. He discovers that one of his former training comrades, Jack Krauser (Jim Ward), who was believed to have been killed in a helicopter crash two years prior, is responsible for her kidnapping. Ada and Krauser are working with Albert Wesker (Richard Waugh), for whom both intend to secure a Plagas sample. Suspicious of the mercenary's intentions, Saddler orders Krauser to kill Leon, believing that no matter which one dies, he will benefit. After Krauser's fatal defeat, Leon rescues Ashley, and they remove the Plagas from their bodies using a specialized radiotherapeutic device. Leon confronts Saddler, and with Ada's help, manages to kill him. However, Ada takes the sample from Leon at gunpoint before escaping in a helicopter, leaving Leon and Ashley to escape via her jet-ski as the island explodes.",

The game takes place in North America, as the United States are blown apart by a fearsome enemy.\r\nThe protagonist is a former US pilot, caught in the middle of the chaos that erupted in his country. Parts of the states are occupied, and police are rampaging in the streets, confronted by American rebels. The main mechanics of the game are shared with most of the linear shooters of the time, but the setting of the story adds a new flavor to the well-known system. The most prominent feature is combat and weapons, as the developers tried to make them as realistic as possible, allowing players to experience the hardships of modern rebels fully.\r\nHomefront features a multiplayer mode, where players can engage in fierce battles, arming themselves with various weapons and using different vehicles, ranging from AFVs to helicopters, to gain an extra edge over the enemy.",

The gameplay features special combat mechanics: each Bro has two different attacks (first is constant and endless, while the second requires recharging) and a melee weapon to climb the obstacles. However, enemies can be also defeated by using distracting maneuvers. Bros also have special abilities like parkour skill or explosion resistance.

The way he completes them, however, is what makes Postal 2 one of the most censored and offensive games ever.

The game, however, is just as violent as the player wants it to be. Most missions can be accomplished without killing, though it would have spoiled all the fun.\nThe gameplay has changed since the previous part. Isometric view from the original was replaced with the first-person view. The world around Postal Dude is living by itself, regardless of the player’s presence, much like in Grand Theft Auto series.

Resolving conflicts between local citizens and Hong Kong’s organized crime, the protagonist is offered to join one of the city’s gangs. Due to this, the players need to plan their actions carefully, building trust among both the gangsters and the police. \nThe game features an unlock-based role-playing system, where every consecutive ability or trait is unlocked after the player achieves a specific goal or levels up character’s prestige in each of the three in-game groups. The combat system is heavily reliant on the character’s skill of martial arts, but conventional weaponry is also a favorable choice. Non-story related interactions add flavor to the overall gameplay, as there is a wide choice of how to spend the protagonist’s free time.",

However, not every battle is won by plans, and thus, reaction to the surroundings also plays a significant role.\nCompany of Heroes successfully reimagined how WWII RTS should look like and play like, with its different squad compositions, various routes to be taken, and new challenges in the form of multiplayer battles with players who will try to outcompete you, outplay you and overrun your forces.",

You play as Bob, a fully customizable character that travels from one dream to another. Bob has neither no background nor superpowers. His abilities don’t differ from yours: he can grab things, climb ledges and so on. \n\nEvery level consists of multiple puzzles that can be solved in different ways. You can push and pull carts, break walls and interact with everything else comparable to your own size. The game heavily focuses on physics. Puzzles’ solutions are intuitive and make you act like in real life. In their core levels are quite linear: you need to reach the door at another side of the location to get into the next dream. While at the first levels you need to find exits from tiny rooms, the further you go, the larger locations become. There is a lot of content in the game in general, and it clearly references the sandbox genre where you can do almost everything you want.",

The \"stalkers\" in this world are the explorers who wander The Zone in search of valuable loot. You play as the Marked One, a stalker who lost his memory. All that remains of his past is a memo that says “Kill Strelok”. The Marked One will have to learn more about himself, Strelok, The Zone, and its mysteries.

To stay alive, he will need to learn how to light a campfire, find shelter, care about his wounds, hunt for food and protect himself in an unfriendly environment.

There's very little interactivity and zero action; you just walk around a rocky Scottish island in autumn. The major events of the plot are set in the past, and we only learn about them through the voice of the unseen narrator - the only voice in the game – who will read a certain letter from his past when he approaches a certain place. The letters slowly unfurl the mystery around him as you visit various locations on an island: the lighthouse, the cave, and others. The world of Dear Esther is far from open, and you can only follow the restricted pathways. To unlock all the achievements and find every audio clip, however, may require several walkthroughs.\n\nThe Landmark Edition is based on the Unity 5 engine and contains better graphics, minor interface improvements and a system of achievements.

Like with all LEGO games, its visual style imitates a world that is entirely made of LEGO constructions and inhabited by mini-figures.\n\n###Plot\nThe game follows the plot of the movies rather than the original book. LEGO The Hobbit recreates The Hobbit story using voice samples from the movies, while also parodying it with the addition of the tongue-in-cheek humor. The plot takes place in the high fantasy world of Middle-Earth. Bilbo Baggins, the main protagonist, is a hobbit. He lived a peaceful life until one day a company of thirteen dwarves and the wizard named Gandalf called him to join them on an adventure. Bilbo and his new friends left out on a quest to reconquer the dwarves' home, the Lonely Mountain, and its treasures from the wicked dragon Smaug. \n\n###Gameplay\nThe player controls the Thorin's party, switching between characters when needed. Each character has his unique abilities, such as climbing or shooting arrows. The game is divided into a series of short, linear levels that correspond to certain scenes in the movies. On the way, the player has to smash objects made of LEGO and sometimes use them to assemble new objects. The game also has a cooperative multiplayer for two.",

Each character has different skills and special abilities, so the squad should be appropriately chosen in advance.

The remaining four – the Mole, the Gentleman, the Redhead, and the Hacker – will be unlocked during the further game progress. The gameplay is about completing levels in multiple ways depending on the players’ character choice.

The general outline of the whole line of these games is the confrontation of special forces, to be more precise, a soldier named \"Operative\", and a squad of super-soldier clones who refused to obey their superiors. Rebellious clone soldiers are capable of even cannibalism, and other details of the setting correspond to this level of fear.\nProtagonists and antagonists have unusual abilities or conventional abilities, developed to an unusually high level. This is manifested, among other things, in the possession of ghostly forms, by which it is possible to mislead other people.\n\nThe game is strictly from the first person. A notable feature of the gameplay is the slow motion mode. In this mode, the player accelerates the perception to such an extent that it can see the flying bullets. This gives him obvious advantages. The slow motion mode, in the game, is explained by the increased content of adrenaline in the blood, which occurs in a person, in a situation that threatens life. If this condition is caused in a natural way, then it does not last long. It can be extended with the help of a special drug, which is included in the number of useful game stuff. Sometimes this mode is \"turned on\" during visions that visit the hero and act on him as much as the danger.",

The ammo and other resources in the game are scarce, forcing the player to use a tactical approach.\r\nThe game gives a spotlight to women in the military who are among the main characters in the campaign. The player might also choose to play a female character in the multiplayer, as the gender is not tied to a class. The game also allows the players many customization options for costumes, vehicles, and weapons.\r\n\r\n###Modes\r\nBattlefield V has many multiplayer modes, some of which are new to the series and some are reimagined versions of the modes from previous games. For example, The Grand Operations mode is based on the original Battlefield mode called Operations. This mode imitates a military campaign and consists of a series of battles with different objectives and non-linear progress options.",

Each time players simply spawn on the playing field, where they can interact freely with game figures and pieces. All the craziness occurs within the realistic physical model, which the developers have added for greater similarity to the real prototypes. In addition to the insanity that can be arranged in multiplayer along with ten other players, the game engine supports the ability to use preset rules for different board games and thus play them.\n\n###Key features\nThere are several games included. For example, chess, poker, and checkers. The set is small, but the game supports Steam Workshop and the ability to download your own models of figures and game boards. Thus, players added to the standard set of three games three thousand more variations, most of which are variations on games, for the inclusion of which developers will have to purchase a license.",

    "description": "###The restart\nReleased in 2016, the remastered version of one of the most revolutionary parts of the annual Call of Duty series. In 2007, the series moved from historical scenery to modern, got a new more advanced graphics thanks to the freshly-released consoles and presented to the players a hardcore fast-paced multiplayer. The latter is still wanted by hardcore fans, which gave the publisher Activision Blizzard a reason to remaster the game.\n\n###Key features\nIn the new version, developers from the Raven Software did their best to rebuild the experience (the original game was developed by Infinity Ward). The game is available for purchase, as a separate product, and as part of a bundle. Owners of the original version of the game can get Remastered for free - you need to have the original disk for this or digital purchase. The re-released game did not change the gameplay in any way: it is still a fast-paced first-person shooter. The story campaign, during which the player takes control of several characters, also has not changed. Most of the changes turned out to be cosmetic and allowed the new studio to add new technologies to the original game: for example, while prone and moving, the weapon touching the ground will vibrate the controller. Also in the single-player campaign, new cheat codes were added, such as exaggerated physics and the ability to replace heads on the shoulders of virtual people with watermelons.\n\n###The changes\nThe main changes lie in multiplayer, which pulled up to the standard of modern games of the series. In place, there were the same modes, the same weapons, and perks. Added new ones, like the Prop Hunt mode, in which players turn into nonliving objects and hide on the map. New content is available as the challenges unfold.",

The movie \"Saving Private Ryan\" served as the main inspiration for the mod. In one of the later updates, the movie's sound effects were added to the modification. \n\nPlayers can choose between two teams: Axis and U.S. Army. At the beginning of the round, the teams spawn in their own spawn areas. The goal of either team is to complete their objectives the list of which depends on the map played and prevent the other team from completing theirs. The game ends if one of the teams completes all their objectives or when the time limit expires in which case the team with the most completed objectives wins. \n\nThe list of weaponry resembles those used in the World War II. The game features hard recoil and the players are unable to fire when running or jumping. \n\nThe list of maps offered on game's release consisted of 15 maps which varied in size and locations. The most notable examples are Omaha Beach and Operation Avalanche.\n\nDoD was later ported on Source engine and released as Day Of Defeat: Source.",

You will explore the forbidden area around Chernobyl, Ukraine, after a new disaster that turned into The Zone, a post-apocalyptic wasteland full of mutants. The setting was inspired by a Russian sci-fi book Roadside Picnic and its adaptation Stalker. Scar, the main character of Clear Sky, is a stalker, which in this world is a term for guides and explorers in The Zone. He was hit by an energy beam that gave him a superhuman ability to survive The Zone’s phenomena. Scar joins the Clear Sky, a secret science organization that studies The Zone’s anomalies. Strelok, an important character from the previous game, appears as the main antagonist. \nLike its predecessor, Clear Sky is a combination of first-person shooter gameplay with RPG mechanics like skills, leveling up, dialogue, and inventory. The player is free to explore the open world and accept quests unrelated to the central plot from various NPCs and factions. Compared to Shadow of Chernobyl, the prequel has improved graphics, additional options for customization and equipment repair and a complete day/night cycle.",

Resident Evil Revelations keeps the story and mechanics from the previous installments.  It’s set between Resident Evil 4 and 5, taking place right after the creation of BSAA. Agents Jill Valentine and Parker are sent to the cruise ship Queen Zenobia in order to find two missing field agents Chris Redfield and Jessica. But they find a trap, set by a bioterrorist organization Veltro. And now players will have to solve puzzles and to kill monsters. \nRevelations are using an episodic storytelling format, separating single player campaign into different segments, allowing players to experience different scenarios and play as several characters throughout the game. But it keeps the main focus and the events on the ghost ship. But aside from the single-player campaign, players can try to complete modified story mode scenarios, fitted for the combat survival. Completing the Raid Mode objectives will allow one or two players to receive experience points and weapons.",

The game is made in a cinematic manner to transfer the zombie apocalypse atmosphere correctly. The gameplay is divided into levels and consists of walking through platforms and solving puzzles. Players can use Randall’s ability to entrap zombies by luring them into environmental hazards, and other mechanics of running, creeping and climbing obstacles to bypass enemies. Although the protagonist has many hostiles, combat is unavoidable in only a few situations. However, the game features some melee weapons with extremely limited ammunition, so the fight is going to be tough.",

It is set in a colorful fantasy world, which we see from the top-down view, and is all about gladiatorial arena combat. The battles take place in one of the five areas, each with its distinct visual themes, such as jungle or lava. Each map is centered around the Middle Orb that can be destroyed to gain additional power and will respawn over the course of the game. Matches are divided into rounds and, to win a match, a team has to score three round victories. Each round has a two-minute time limit, so as to push players toward a fast-paced gameplay. When the time expires, a \"battle royale\" mechanic sets in, shrinking the game area to force the players to meet at the center of the map and fight.\n\nThere are more than 20 characters, or \"champions\" to choose from, and the roster continues to grow. Those champions include magicians, warriors and everything in between.  Each champion has his or her unique set of nine skills. Timing is important when using characters' abilities, as a low-level skill used at the right time can deal more damage than a mistimed high-level spell.",

    "description": "After the nuclear war, people have to survive, and 7 Days to Die gives players the opportunity to experience it. The large parts of the planet are ravaged by destruction, and lone survivors are under the constant threat, even within relatively safe counties, like Navezgane, Nevada.  This is where players are dropped into the randomly generated map and from now on it’s up for them to find resources to defend and feed themselves. \n7 Days to Die is a voxel-based survival game, which means that building is simple and environments are destructible. Gathered and found objects are degrading through use, so it forces players into the constant search for better equipment. The name of the game hints at the horde mechanic, where every seventh day a large group of zombies is swarming the players' location. Players will be killed in that case, unless preparations for the attack are sufficient enough. The game supports multiplayer, where other players can connect to the game server and be cooperative or hostile towards each other.",

The weapons may be customized: there are three gem slots in each one with the gems improving different characteristics in the armament. Due to the detailed battle system, it is allowed to cut an enemy into pieces and tear him apart in different ways, shooting, for example, his limbs off. A hero moves through levels, overcomes obstacles and climbs walls. There is no linear structure to the game as early missions can be replayed and newer location re-explored — that is one of the contrasts with the previous installment the title is made. Non-story-related levels are generated procedurally — it means their layout differs from time to time. There is a four-player cooperative mode, in which a party can walk through the same campaign levels together.\n\n###Plot \nThe narrative centers around Yakuza — the gang is trying to force Lo Wang — the protagonist — to accomplish the job of reclaiming a piece of jewelry from a local Shrine. The story circles around relationships between the characters, mutations due to ancient relics and the adventures in Indiana Jones style.",

The game received praise for managing to keep the same feel as the first game and taking advantage of the transition to improve it further. This sequel includes both new and returning items and playable characters, new locations and all new mechanics, such as Lunar items, special items with powerful effects and major drawbacks to counterbalance them.\n\nAt the time of writing, Risk of Rain 2 is still in early access.

The game is well-known for its design choices and enemy behavior - to run in big waves directly to a player. The story of the game is about extraterrestrial being named Mental who wants to destroy humanity and alien race called Sirians who left lots of artefacts to be discovered by humans. Humans in order to survive choose to use \"Time-Lock\" - an ancient Sirian artefact in hopes to kill Mental's army of grotesque monsters.

The player assumes the role of US special forces operative Karl Fairburne. His task is to eliminate the Nazi German general Franz Vahlen before he completes his project of a doomsday weapon. The locations and background events are inspired by the real historical places and battles.\nThe gameplay is strongly oriented towards stealth action. Your protagonist is a talented marksman who can use a variety of sniper rifles. Finding a perfect spot to snipe from is as important as changing it, since you cannot hold one position for too long without being detected. Fairburne’s condition and the environment influence his accuracy; for example, he cannot shoot straight after running or against the wind. A unique targeting system allows you to see where your bullet will hit the enemy’s body or a vehicle and the amount of damage it can deal. Fairburne can also use other types of guns, as well as explosives. Kills earn the player the points that push your character towards higher ranks. Besides the story mode, there’s a co-op mode and five multiplayer modes, including the classic deathmatch and “capture the flag”.",

Each battle is preceded by a cutscene that further reveals the plot, and each boss requires a unique approach.\nThe game is played in an isometric top-down view. The combat system is very simple, it includes no combos and consists of only four basic movements. The Stranger can slash with his sword, fire his gun, block an incoming attack or dash forward to avoid it. Each action can be made more powerful by holding its button for several seconds, although it slows down your movement.",

At the beginning of the game, we know little about him, but it's still more than he knows about himself - Alex does not remember anything, does not even know that he has super abilities.\n\nAbilities are very useful to him, because he will have to stop the epidemic and at the same time hide from the army, police and mercenaries.\n\n###Plot\nAlex comes to the senses in Ghentec's morgue, located in its Manhattan headquarters. Apparently, the reason for his awakening was the noise produced by mercenaries of the organization Blackwatch, trying to break open the doors of this headquarters.\n\nAlex tries to hide, run away. The mercenaries try to stop him, but Alex discovers in himself one by one amazing abilities - he is not harmed by bullets, he can jump high, throw heavy objects, run on the walls of buildings. And he can \"absorb\" people, taking their appearance and gaining knowledge about everything that the absorbed people know and remember. For example, after the takeover of one of the commanders of Blackwatch, Alex finds out that he has a sister.\n\nAlex finds his sister and learns from her (this time without absorption) that he was an important employee of the company, at the headquarters of which we met him at the beginning of the game. Alex's job duties included working with biological weapons.\n\nDuring the game, the army and the police consider Alex guilty of creating and spreading the virus, Blackwatch pursues Alex for other reasons, and Alex himself tries to stop the mutants and other opponents with all the power of their super abilities. Soon it turns out that among these superpowers there is the ability to turn his body into almost anything, including weapons, shield and armor.\n\n###Gameplay\n\nAll of Manhattan from the very beginning of the game is open for the game. Outside of Manhattan, however, you can not get out. The player can follow the story, and can perform separate missions. Due to the presence of super abilities, the hero can move both horizontally and on walls. But not as an insect, but just running. Falling from the height does not hurt Alex, so he can use this trick to defeat opponents - literally falling on their heads.\n  \nAlex can jump very high, and manage to plan in the air.\n\nAlex fights, using the ability of his body to transform. His hands can turn into sledgehammers, blades, whips or shields. He can instantly increase the volume of his body's muscles to increase their strength - in normal mode, such a mass would have prevented him, so he does not wear all these muscles all the time. His skin can be turned into armor. He can also see in the dark and distinguish mutants from normal people by eyes.\n\nAll abilities can also be improved as you progress in the game and perform various tasks.\n\nIn addition to the super powers of the body, the hero uses assault rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers, rocket launchers, captures infantry combat vehicles, tanks, helicopters and uses their weapons.",

However, in this game, much attention is paid to the tactical component.\n\nFights, as a rule, are not large crowds of troops, but small groups of 4-8 people and the number of military equipment is calculated units.

It is also the earliest game in the Fallout universe inner chronology, thus serving as a prequel to the whole series.\r\n\r\n###Setting\r\nThe game takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, a quarter century after a nuclear holocaust that turned most of the US into a radioactive wasteland. The players assume the roles of the various dwellers of Vault 76, presumably the first Vault-Tec bunker to release its inhabitants. Their goal is to reclaim the world. The vault is located in the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia. Fallout 76 offers an open world with many locations based on real West Virginia places. Some of the new monsters are also based on the local folklore.\r\n\r\n###Gameplay\r\nUnlike all previous games in its series, Fallout 76 features no human NPCs (although robots and monsters are present). Instead, the game delivers the story through records and environment. Some of Fallout series famous mechanics return in Fallout 76. The character creation is based on a modified version of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system of abilities and perks. V.A.T.S. targeting system also appears, albeit this time it works in real-time. The game allows the players to build homes and establish settlements in any part of the map. There are also nuclear missiles that allow the players to annihilate each other's settlements.",

Sometimes you can return the unwound yarn back to the \"body\", sometimes you can increase the amount of yarn, finding a new piece.\nThe most valuable thing Yarni finds is memories. Memories of a family of people, from which he \"comes\" himself. Memories are painted with different emotions, a sufficient number of collected memories opens the entrance to the following levels. In the game there are two lines of events. Events of the past arise as memories, they are found by Yarni.

In it’s well proven genre-defining format, SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE distills and expands on the same intoxicating rhythm of slow motion combat.\nThe game will force you through dozens of increasingly difficult time-moves-only-when-you-move gameplay challenges. Each challenge will make you more powerful and bring you closer to deciphering the secrets hidden from you by the system. As you unlock powerful abilities and gain access to new playable characters, so will your enemies grow stronger, smarter and more desperate to stop you.\nCome and join the fray. Play in Early Access. Let the system learn from you.SUPERHOT rogue-like expansion early access hype! What to expect now?\nWe’re still a good 9-12 months away from a full release, so please don’t forget that this is nowhere close to a complete, satisfying experience just yet. The current build of MIND CONTROL DELETE is the first time we’re inviting you to check out a few of the brand new gameplay systems that are going to be central to the game:\nFirst 2 playable MINDS, each with it’s own unique ability and gameplay modifiers\nA kaleidoscope of the first dozen new gameplay levels that mix into the first few dozen combat challenges\nNew animation and AI systems to drive new weapons, abilities, and enemy types\nHitpoint system and power-up store to give you that extra oompf needed to crush your enemies and see them driven before you\nProcedural rogue-like run generation baked into the core gameplay loop, enabling us to tell longer, more complex stories and deliver tons more of satisfying skill-based gameplay\nBeware though - this is an extremely early, bleeding-edge version of most of those systems. The limitations for this early access build are not for the faint of heart:\nNo story whatsoever - we don’t want to spoil too much too quickly so this and the next few updates will be all about gameplay features\nNo advanced power-ups or new enemy types enabled yet - we want to establish and test the balance of vanilla gameplay in this build, waiting to sprinkle in gamebreaking modifiers and new foes to beat up until future updates\nNo replay or point system - easy bragging about your insane skills will need to wait\nAbsolutely no hidden menu minigames yet - we have so many new cool ones coming out super soon tho <3\nIf you’re not looking for an incomplete game that’s in constant flux and relies on your feedback and creativity to expand, or if you’d rather just play a finished experience that’s guaranteed to challenge and satisfy you and your deepest power fantasies, then we totally recommend you should wait until MIND CONTROL DELETE is out of early access.\nHowever, if you’re super brave and want to help guide the development in its earliest stages, then go ahead - join us, and get your name in the credits!Why are you putting MIND CONTROL DELETE in early access in the first place tho?\nWe released the original SUPERHOT in February 2016 after nearly two years of intense creative crunch. The amazing support during the development from our Kickstarter backers and the exhilarating reaction we got from you once the game released was simply mind blowing.\nWith morale at an all-time high, we immediately jumped into a flurry of prototyping and refining gameplay and story concepts that we weren’t able to fit into the original game. We tested and put a bunch of them to work in virtual reality, and after releasing SUPERHOT VR to even more outstanding support from you guys, we finally had a road map for the first non-VR expansion ironed out in December 2016. In our usual no-compromise approach to design, we made that roadmap way more ambitious than originally anticipated and we decided to make the expansion a fully standalone game, allowing us to rewrite and reimagine all of our major gameplay systems.\nThe single most important strength of the original SUPERHOT was the amazing involvement of tens of thousands of creative alpha and beta testers that helped us shape and balance the game and drove us to pursue zero compromises in design. After over a year of work on MIND CONTROL DELETE, we’re now ready to start this adventure together again. We’re inviting you to jump in and co-create the game with us. Talk to us, work with us, and let’s build the build the biggest SUPERHOT yet together.What’s the price tag on this? Is this that free DLC you were talking about?\nYup! Way bigger than the usual free DLC though, so it'll take a bit longer to release. If you own the original SUPERHOT on Steam now or buy it while MIND CONTROL DELETE is still in Early Access, you’ll get the full expansion for free once it’s finished and released.\nHowever if you can’t wait to work with us, and you feel like bravely facing rough edges and helping shape the game as it develops, then we’ll be thrilled to have you sign your name to a piece of SUPERHOT history and join us in Early Access right now.\nOnce MIND CONTROL DELETE releases in earnest, it will be priced same as the other SUPERHOT games for everyone who’s still new to the franchise.FAQ\nShould I buy MIND CONTROL DELETE if I haven’t played the original SUPERHOT?\nNot right now. The game will be a totally standalone experience in a few updates, but the lack of clear structure and story right now would be confusing for newcomers. Definitely get the original SUPERHOT though. It’s lots of fun.\nWhat’s the update roadmap?\nWe’re new to Early Access, but we’re hoping to use your feedback and collaboration to drive and guide the development.

    "description": "This sequel to the comic dark fantasy Overlord allows the player to have fun being evil. You play as the dark Overlord who leads his armies of minions against the human Glorious Empire (which obviously mimics the real-world Roman Empire). The Glorious Empire is not \"good\" anyway: its leaders are trying to eliminate all magic users, so the \"evil\" motivation is quite justified. However, to accomplish his conquest and become a truly powerful and feared dark lord, you will have to commit some really vile deeds. One of your first missions, for example, involves slaughtering baby seals.\nThe game follows the Overlord from his childhood, as he grows from a nasty kid to a mighty dark knight that looks a lot like Sauron as shown in The Fellowship of the Ring movie. The Overlord begins his conquest with a pack of goblins and a single troll, but over time his minions will develop into more powerful and deadly creatures and attack the enemy in large hordes. The game does not turn into a strategy, however, as you still only directly control the dark lord himself, and the minions are commanded through his orders.  Overlord II is famous for its humor: the game does not take itself too seriously. There are all sorts of puns and parodies on the stereotypical villains and other fantasy tropes, such as elves and fairies. Goblin minions squeak, cringe and fall, while playful Danny-Elfman-esque music is echoing in the background.",

This is the fourth installment in the Elite video games series and it's the sequel to Frontier: First Encounters. This is one of those successful Kickstarter campaigns which launched in 2012. The pre-released version of Elite Dangerous was available since December 2013 and after one long year it was finally released as a full game on Microsoft Windows. In 2015 it was released on OS X and Xbox One and one year later  - on PlayStation 4. The game also supports VR devices including HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.\nElite Dangerous is set in a year 3304. Its premise, as with the other games in the series, is to start as a small ship with a small amount of money and then with measures of trading, mining, bounty-hunting, piracy and assassination to go up your career. \nThere are three different factions in the game including Empire of Achenar, the Galactic Federation, and the Alliance of Independent Systems and four player status levels (combat, CQC Championship, exploration and trading).",

Mario awakens in the Cap Kingdom inhabited with hat-like spirits and befriends one of them named Cappy.

The game consists 17 levels (named as “kingdoms”). In most of them, your goal is to collect a certain amount of Power Moons. Collecting enough of them allows the player to progress to the next kingdom. Some moons can be found in different parts of the level or acquired as a reward for completing certain tasks or challenges. The Mario’s moveset mostly resembles that of Super Mario 64 and includes wall jumps, triple jumps, somersaults, long jumps, rolling on the ground. The main new gameplay feature is that Mario can throw his hat to create temporary platforms, grab objects, attack enemies, or possess them.

Mess around with a massive variety of units. Everything from, Roman Centurions, Medieval soldiers, Knights, Orcs, Trolls, and yes, chickens! The main focus in this game is giving the player no restrictions to what he can do. That is why we decided not to limit the amount of units in battle. Want to see what a battle of 100,000 units looks like? We don't recommend going past 10,000 for most machines but its your CPU, do what you want! On top of that, you can play as any one of the units in the game, getting up close and personal to help change the tides of a massive battle, while rallying teammates and giving them orders!\nThe Technology:\nUnfortunately there really aren't many engines that you can chuck 10,000 characters in and expect good performance. This is why I worked months on end to create the most powerful crowd rendering system ever conceived in Unity engine. The detail of each character has little effect on performance while each individual acts independently, but is working towards a greater good for his team.  Each individual decides his own path and navigates complex environments. But I didn't stop there! With the large open environments, I needed a more dynamic lighting solution than the one built in to Unity engine. So I built my own dynamic global illumination lighting engine. This enables bounce light completely in real time. What does that mean? That means every piece of shiny armor is reflecting it's true surroundings, every bright surfaces illuminates it's surroundings and effects the overall lighting.\nYes I worked hard to bring this game to life, may you all inflict carnage upon it!",

There's an extensive backstory that explains the protagonist's motivation in gathering Starites. We learn that Max and his sister Lily played pranks on people using their magic notebook until it got them into trouble. One day they unknowingly played a trick against an old wizard. He grew angry and magically turned Lily into stone. Max can only save his sister by gathering enough Starites. Unlike previous parts, this game is set in an open, albeit cartoonish, world, that gradually opens to you as you gather more Starites. The tasks are now assigned by the NPCs, and Starites are given as a reward for help. Thus, they serve as the proof that Max has corrected his behavior.",

The class system is absent as the developers want the players to define their own classes using the weapons of their own creation.\n\nThere are no in-game paywalls, but if the player wants to unlock all the customization options or the best weapon modules, they have to either grind the in-game currency or buy it for real money.\n\nThe game features 4 competitive multiplayer modes and a co-op mode where 4 players complete missions which are divided into 5 or 6 parts with each mission having a different goal. A lot of missions revolve around killing aliens known as Kroads. After each mission, the players are awarded loot boxes, in-game currency or other in-game items.",

You can choose the character's profession before the apocalypse. Subsequently, this will affect some of the skills (for example, a former policeman shoots better, a builder builds defenses better, nurses heal wounds more successfully, cooks cook better, etc.).\n\nYou can then choose the positive and negative traits of the character. The negative ones include obesity, laziness, poor eyesight, chronic fatigue, constant thirst, etc. For the chosen negative traits you get points - these points can be spent on the positive traits of this character, such as agility, strength, high disease resistance and even luck.\n\nAfter creating a character, you (or rather, a character) find yourself in a randomly selected house on a game map. The zombie apocalypse has already begun, and your character has to look for a way to survive. In the game, not even very moral ways are allowed to do this: you can loot and rob, you can create a group of honest people and resist both zombies and bandits.\n\nIn addition to winning battles, the hero needs food, water, sleep, rest, and fellowship to survive - constant loneliness can lead to depression.\n\nThe complexity of the game increases constantly and gradually - the activity of zombies increases, electricity and water supply are turned off, and the products deteriorate. However, the player is able to provide a lot for himself - to cook food on a fire, collect rainwater, grow food.\n\nHowever, no action can ensure eternal survival - sooner or later the character dies.

Since its initial release in 2012, it has received two free extensions, Skullgirls Encore and Skullgirls 2nd Encore and while its roster initially consisted of an all-female cast of 8 characters, 6 more characters were added, 5 being developed thanks to the game's Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign, including 2 male characters. At its release, Skullgirls was developed by Reverge Labs, but the team that created the game split off from the company to form Lab Zero. In Japan, the game is published by Arc System Works. On Nintendo Switch, the game is published by Skybound Games.\n\nSkullgirls takes place in the Canopy Kingdom, inspired by 1940s America, in which corruption and conflict runs rampant. Once every seven years, an artifact called the Skull Heart appears, granting the wish of one woman. However, if the Skull Heart is used by a woman with impure intentions, it will control her, turning her into a destructive monster called the Skullgirl. Not once has anyone used the Skull Heart without falling to its curse. The game follows the stories of 14 characters on their way to face the Skullgirl and retrieve the Heart, be it for the greater good or simply their own gain.\n\nThe game is a tribute to Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and its mechanics are intended as a more polished version of the classic fighting game title, with some original ideas. In a standard player vs. player match, each player controls one character out a chosen number of one to three characters which they can switch to at any time. They can also call their inactive characters to perform assist attacks. Like most Marvel vs. Capcom-inspired games, Skullgirls is fast-paced and features long, complex combos based on animation cancels. It introduces a burst system which allows players to break their opponent's combo if it becomes too long.\n\nSkullgirls features a 'dark deco'-inspired art style mixed with some horror themes and a jazz and rock soundtrack consisting of 28 tracks. In 2013, the game set the Guinness World Record Gamer's Edition record for most average frames of animation per character in a video game, reaching 1,439 frames per character and 11,515 frames total for its initial eight-character roster.\n\nIn February 2013, Skullgirls came in second in a crowdfunding event organized by fighting game website Shoryuken to decide what would be the final game featured on the EVO 2013 line up, with all proceeds sent to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. Skullgirls raised over $US 78,000. While it was not featured as an EVO main game, EVO organizers supported the game's side event by providing prize money and advertisement.",

Despite these releases coming out years ago, they are still alive and actively updated. But the developers at Blizzard wanted something new: the company does not like to experiment with new settings, preferring to transfer existing characters to new genres, worlds, and situations. The exception, perhaps, can only be a game about the three Vikings—The Lost Vikings, but this, too, was a long time ago.\n\n###The story and setting\nAnyway, the company Blizzard has approached the development of Overwatch with team-specific meticulousness to details and desire to create an elaborative game universe. The player faces a choice between 21 characters who were part of the elite Overwatch unit. The task of Overwatch soldiers is to protect the Earth from conflicts and external threats. But something goes wrong, and the team of heroes breaks up. Despite the multiplayer bias, the game has a full story, it combines all the characters and maps on which the battle takes place. Since the launch, seven new characters have been added to the hero pool. Blizzard tells the story of the world of Overwatch through their characters: almost everyone has an animated short film, comparable in quality to a full meter from, for example, Pixar.\n\n###Continuous support\nThe game won the hearts of players around the world immediately after the launch. The figures confirm this fact: more than half a million dollars from sales and more than 40 million players. Overwatch has become an anchor project for Activision Blizzard, and the company continues to develop the project two years later, constantly offering players new maps, new characters, new themed events, and new cosmetic skins.",

If you're killed, you'll respawn near your Rift for a certain score. \nEach trap or spell costs the in-game currency you earn by defeating enemies. At the beginning of the level, you choose up to ten items for the battle. As a rule, all traps only work once and then need some time to recharge. Every item is upgradable; on higher levels, you can also get some boosts that will affect that level only.\nThe game is followed by Orcs Must Die! 2 that features a co-op mode, and Orcs Must Die! Unchained, a free-to-play follow-up.",

He wanted to create a game which focuses on story. He decided to use live action footage and created a police procedural game. In order to make it as much realistic as possible, Barlow watched lots of real police interviews, by doing so he discovered that there is a lot of ambiguity in those files and he wanted to incorporate that into the game as well.  \r\nThe game was praised because of its original narrative, character performance and interesting gameplay mechanics.",

We have to fly to 'Far, Far Range', to build there something like a ranch for slimes and for all this to hire earthlings. One of these earthlings, the space rancheros, the brave young girl Beatrix LeBeau is the character of the game. The girl (and the player) will fly a thousand light-years in a deep sleep to equip a ranch from a Hobson Twillgers, study the planet's environment, collect, feed and breed slimes.\n\nTo get the necessary hints the girl can look for notes of the former owner - they meet on the territory of the ranch, and also communicate via Star Mail with a close friend from the Earth. In conversations with a friend, we learn a lot of things about the former, earthly life of the heroine - this information will be important.\n\n###Gameplay and economics\nSlimes need to be fed, and this is important. The rest they will do themselves.\nIt is necessary to feed them not by anything, but by appropriate products. But slimes will produce a lot of Plort - and Plort can be sold on the market, having received currency - newbucks. For newbucks you can buy equipment for ranches and so on. The world of the game is not known until the end, it is possible and necessary to travel through it, opening up new locations, finding new slimes for the ranch, as well as food for slimes and other new resources.\n\nFrom different types of slimes you can get hybrids. However, with this you need to be more careful - you can get aggressive evil slimes, which will have to be dissolved with water.\n\nSlimes are quite diverse. Ordinary slimes are generally friendly, but they can be dangerous not because of evil will, but because of some natural features like thorns, emitted radiation or the ability to explode.\n\nSome slimes are more productive than others, they produce more Plort. It is these slimes that are created by hybridization, since it is difficult to find them in a natural environment.\n\nOrdinary slimes sometimes merge into a huge Gordo-slime - inside such organisms there are often valuable resources and other interesting and useful things. To get all this, you need to blow up the Gordo-slime.\n\n###Game modes\nAdventure. The world is open for research, there are no serious restrictions. You can develop as you want. You can communicate with other ranchers, carry out their assignments and exchange resources with them. \n\nCarefree is an adventure mode that goes even easier.\n\nThe five-day trial is a mode in which you need to earn as many newbucks as possible in 5 days.\n\n\"The steel master of the ranch\" - the conditions in this mode are so complicated that it resembles a game of survival. In the mode there are unique tests that change the impression of the game.",

Trico, in turn, needs the boy’s wits and agility to sneak, solve puzzles, feed the creature and heal its wounds. The player only controls the boy, while Trico needs to be manipulated into performing certain actions. Over time, the characters develop a strong emotional bond that adds to the game’s impact on the player.",

Everything moves with incredible speed and the task to keep up is not a simple one.

The gang has Kane’s family as hostages and wants the money back. Kane, Lynch, and other criminals they will hire have to gather the required sum by robbing banks, kidnapping people for ransom, and completing other criminal tasks. Gameplay in Kane & Lynch is slightly reminiscent of GTA series with its third-person cop-shooting massacres. However, instead of the open world, there are consecutive levels with a mission in each, like in Hitman series (which was made by the same studio). \nIn the story mode, Kane is the only protagonist under the player’s control. Lynch and other members of the gang are AI-controlled, though Kane can order them to move, follow, or attack. In the co-op mode, the other player can assume the role of Lynch. Playing for him is a little different because Lynch is a psychopath who sees hallucinations. There’s also an online multiplayer mode called Fragile Alliance that includes several new maps. In this mode, the team of players tries to survive the police assault and reach their getaway car.",

His job is to collect the evidence, such as fingerprints and fluids, and send it to the FBI forensic laboratory to find clues to the mystery.

Ethan Thomas mostly uses improvised weapons, like shovels, wrenches and even a mannequin arm.

The game takes place 20 years after an apocalyptic event called Crossout. In 2027 a viral disease pandemic swept across the Earth, driving most people insane.

Many of the survivors have mutated, became aggressive and formed gangs to patrol the wasteland on their hand-made vehicles.\n\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player has to fight enemy characters (in PvE modes) and other players (in PvP battles) using armored cars. Victories increase the player's reputation and allow him or her to join various factions and craft their deadly weapons. There are missions the player can complete to earn more fame, money, and spare parts to customize his or her car.

He or she can enhance the vehicle with weapons, armor, accelerators and other devices to fit his or her driving style. However, the design has to be practical and balanced at least to some extent. Awkwardly built vehicles can lose control or flip over. The blueprints of crafted vehicles can be shared on the 'Exhibition', where players can like and download them, to create a similar car or improve the original design. Game also offers automatic vehicle craft system, which will build a battle machine from the parts in player's storage.",

The protagonist starts his journey in the city of Aleroth. His or her first mission is to save the city’s chief healer who was cursed into madness by an evil wizard. After that, the protagonist is free to explore the world and accept a variety of side quests from NPCs.\n\nThe main character is fully customizable.

Each class has its own set of skills and attributes. However, over the course of the game, the character can learn virtually any skill regardless of his or her class. The game is played from an isometric view using point-and-click controls, thus being quite similar to the Diablo series. Unlike Diablo, it has a stronger leaning towards the classic RPG genre. Divine Divinity includes complex dialogue options, skill trees, and a reputation system.\n\nThe game’s soundtrack was composed by ex-Aria keyboardist Kirill Pokrovsky.",

The game offers the player to \"go postal\" on a spree shooting across the city.\n\n###Plot\nThe player controls the protagonist, nicknamed The Postal Dude: a homeless middle-aged man who apparently goes crazy and hears disembodied voices. He believes in a conspiracy theory that US government has poisoned his hometown with a nerve agent, and he's the only sane person around. He tries to eliminate the crowd he considers \"infected\". His goal is to fight his way to the US Air Force base which he believes is responsible for the presumed attack.\n\n###Gameplay\nUnlike its better-known sequel, POSTAL is 2D and uses top-down and isometric views. On each level, the player has to kill a specified share of enemies: civilians, military, and police alike. When this goal is complete, the door to the next level will appear. The player can complete the level even if The Postal Dude is killed, as long as the number of his own kills is satisfactory. The character can carry up to 8 types of weapons with varying strength and ammo limit. His basic gun is the weakest but has indefinite ammo supply.\n\n###Expansions and adaptations\nThere's an expansion pack Special Delivery that adds more levels and characters. In 2016, the game was remastered and re-released as Postal Redux. The game was unsuccessfully adapted to film by Uwe Boll.",

Six months later it hadn't met its rendezvous point at the Cape of Good Hope and was declared lost at sea.  \r\n \r\nEarly this morning of October 14th, 1807, the Obra Dinn drifted into port with sails damaged and no visible crew. As insurance adjustor for the East India Company's London Office, find means to board the ship and recover the Crew Muster Roll book for assessment.\r\n\r\n(\"Obra\" is pronounced like \"Cobra\" without the C).\r\n\r\nFrom the author:\r\n\r\nGoals\r\n\r\nI want to challenge myself so this'll be a very different game from anything I've done before, including Papers Please. There'll be less creativity with the gameplay and instead I want to experiment with the rendering, story, and a few technical features. Right now I have only a rough idea about the narrative. I'm hoping to capture a compelling mystery with suspense and twists in the limited space of an old merchant sailing ship. It won't be the typical \"collect items and look for clues\" structure. There's a slightly cool gameplay hook but I won't go into details on that until much later.\r\n\r\n\r\nDevlog\r\n\r\nI'll try to keep this (https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=40832.0) devlog lively as I make progress. Because the gameplay itself is more standard, there probably won't be as many creative updates as the Papers Please devlog. I will post lots of pictures and builds as soon as I'm able. Things will likely also move slower than Papers Please did too, at least at the start. P,P still takes a good amount of my time so there's less chance for me to maintain a laser-like focus on one project like last time. The lower bound for finishing this game is around 3 months but realistically I think it'll take me around half a year. My Maya skills are pretty rusty so I expect the modeling/animation to take the most time.\r\n\r\n\r\n1-bit Rendering\r\n\r\nMy first computer was a Mac Plus. I've always had a nostalgia-softened spot in my heart for 1-bit graphics. I'd like to capture the detailed black & white look of old Mac games in a realtime 1st person game. I plan to push it grittier and less cartoon-like than those old games; the hard part will be keeping everything legible without it becoming an unreadable mess of dithered pixels. One interesting problem with 1-bit rendering is that it doesn't scale well for images and it compresses to video like shit - so YouTube stuff may look really poor. We'll see how it goes.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnity 3D\r\n\r\nI'm gonna use Unity for this one. I fell in love with Haxe/OpenFL on my last project but unfortunately the 3D situation is not that great there yet. Also, it's time to finally see why 90% of the indie scene is using Unity. I have a good amount of experience with 3D games and the few days I've played around with Unity so far have been pretty productive. The animated title screen scene up there (with post-processing shaders and all) was created in one day. I now have unrealistically high hopes.",

Finding the right hardware becomes the main task of surviving agents. The player plays the role of their remote operator.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to the X-COM games: all missions are turn-based. Each agent under player’s control has a limited action point that he can use during the turn. Often the main task on the map is to possess a certain object. During the missions, the player can complete additional quests that allow you to open new agents and equipment.",

More than a century before that, the Apophis asteroid fell on Earth, causing mass destruction and driving humanity to near-extinction. The few remaining people hide in the few safe oases, while the rest of the world is a post-apocalyptic wasteland raided by gangsters and evil mutants. The main protagonist is a man named Walker, who is the last ranger of the wasteland and a wielder of superhuman powers. He fights against the totalitarian organization called The Authority.\r\n\r\n###Gameplay\r\nLike in the original RAGE, the sequel emphasizes its over-the-top action. The player controls Walker from the first person view and uses his huge guns and other weapons to fight monsters. The protagonist can also drive any vehicle that can be found in the game and engage in vehicular battles. When the player is driving, the game switches to the third person view. A new feature introduced in RAGE 2 is its Overdrive system that encourages aggressive playing style.

You decide the combat role you want to assume in the world of Brink as you fight to save yourself and mankind’s last refuge. Brink offers a compelling mix of dynamic battlefields, extensive customization options, and an innovative control system that will keep you coming back for more.\nBrink takes place on the Ark, a man-made floating city that is on the brink of all-out civil war. Originally built as an experimental, self-sufficient and 100% “green” habitat, the reported rapid rise of the Earth’s oceans has forced the Ark to become home to not only the original founders and their descendants but also to thousands of refugees. With tensions between the two groups growing, Security and Resistance forces are locked in a heated battle for control of the Ark. Which side will you choose?\n\nKEY FEATURES:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNot Just Another Hero – Brink's advanced player customization offers a near-endless combination of looks for your character – allowing for the appearance of your character to be truly unique.

Brink allows you to seamlessly move between your single player campaign, co-op with friends, and intense multiplayer action. Multiplayer takes the story online where you can play with up to seven other people (or AI characters) cooperatively as you take on the opposing faction or with up to 16 players competitively.\nPlay SMART – Brink uses the familiar shooter controls that you’re used to, without frustrating, artificial constraints and adds a new feature: the SMART button.  When you press the SMART button, the game dynamically evaluates where you’re trying to get to, and makes it happen. Whether you’re a seasoned FPS veteran or someone just getting started, you’ll be able to make more intelligent decisions during the fast-paced action with SMART.\nContext-Sensitive Goals and Rewards - Objectives, communications, missions, and inventory selection are all dynamically generated based on your role, your condition, your location, your squad-mates, and the overall status of the battle in all gameplay modes.

He can get obesity from a plentiful meal, and if he drinks alcohol, he will become poorly oriented and eventually will vomit.\n\nClothing, hairstyles, beards and tattoos of the hero influence how others perceive the hero. For example, light clothing causes benevolence, and dark - fear.\n\nOf course, the attitude towards the hero is influenced by his actions. The proportion of good and evil acts affects his appearance. If he does many good deeds, he has a halo above his head and other signs of holiness. If he is more inclined to evil deeds, he grows horns, smoke comes from under his feet, and his eyes get a red glow.\nThe hero grows old regardless of whether he is good or evil. In his old age, his hair grows gray. If he spends his experience on new skills, he becomes noticeably older. Among the things that you can buy in the city, there is real estate. You can buy a house, rent out and get paid. If you decorate the house with trophies, the rental rate will be greater.\n\nIn addition to the war with the enemies, you can search for treasure and fish or participate in sports fistfights. And even better - try to find the Doors of Demons, who can talk. Doors give tasks, after performing which the hero will pass into hidden locations and acquire rare things.

    "description": "Pyre is an action-adventure game developed by Supergiant games. \n\n###Setting\nThe game is set in some purgatory. After getting banished by the society, the main character finds himself all alone. Three exiles soon approach him and invite the protagonist to party with them and nickname him the Reader. The group sets out to cleanse their souls.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe gameplay of Pyre revolves around some sports game, which is connected with a ritual known as the Rites, which happens in a parallel world. The Protagonist controls his three newly found friends in battles against three opponents on a small arena. Each team has its own pyre. Both pyres oppose each other. The objective of the game is to defend your pyre while attacking the enemy one. The player can only destroy the pyre with the orb, that is spawned in the center of the arena and which has to be grabbed and thrown into the pyre.\n\nDuring a round, the Reader can switch between the character he wants to control and pass the orb from one to another. Each player has their own amount of endurance which is required for moving around the arena. If the players of a team come together, they create a zone that is dangerous for the player that carries the orb. If the player with the orb should get into that zone, they'll be temporarily removed from the game.\n\nWhile free from the Rites, the player can travel through the world of Pyre, train his teammates or try to learn more about the Rites.",

All other players assume the roles of the experts. Their task is to help the defuser by reading aloud a manual about bombs. The experts need to be either in the same room with the defuser or to contact him or her over an audio messenger. \n\nThe defuser is the only player who can see the bomb. He or she has to describe it in details to other players. The experts, in turn, have to find the described blocks in their manuals and tell the defuser what to do to solve the puzzle. \n\n###Bombs as puzzles\nThe composition and other attributes of each bomb are randomly generated for each level, and the players can customize them. The bombs consist of individual blocks, which are puzzles on their own. Some of the blocks require regular attention from the defuser, while others can be disarmed once and for all. \n\nThe time for each level is limited. When the countdown reaches the end, the bomb will explode. Defuser's errors may also speed up the countdown or even activate the bomb and \"kill\" him or her.

With Dark Souls II the main director and founder of Souls-like genre Hidetaka Miyazaki took place only as a supervisor of the project, leaving a place of the director of the game for two young video game designers Tomohiro Shibuya and Yui Tanimura. One could ask if the game is as good and beautiful as other past games in the Series and the answer would be that Dark Souls II is different yet deep and unforgiving as all the other titles in the series. The famous difficulty of previous games is still there but the world is much simpler yet connected and dangerous. Enemies still respond after death of a player but only about 15 times. After that they disappear forever. Boss battles are much simpler, this time focuses on many simpler bosses at a time instead of one powerful boss. \nDark Souls II is one of those games which were painfully downgraded in a favor of hardware of consoles, that means that players got less graphically advanced version than promised. Yet the game is interesting and deep and it’s definitely a must play for every Souls fan.",

The game has no character classes, and the character skills are individual. The process of customization also includes several questions about the character's background. The answers define how the character is perceived by the others and which factions he or she may join. The factions also influence the main character's abilities and the companions the player can recruit. \n\nLike in Pillars of Eternity, the player has to make difficult decisions that strongly influence the plot and the lives of NPCs.

    "description": "RimWorld is a sci-fi colony sim driven by an intelligent AI storyteller. Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Firefly, and Dune.\nYou begin with three survivors of a shipwreck on a distant world.\nManage colonists' moods, needs, wounds, and illnesses.\nFashion structures, weapons, and apparel from metal, wood, stone, cloth, or futuristic materials.\nTame and train cute pets, productive farm animals, and deadly attack beasts.\nWatch colonists develop and break relationships with family members, lovers, and spouses.\nFight pirate raiders, hostile tribes, rampaging animals, giant tunnelling insects and ancient killing machines.\nTrade with passing ships and trade caravans.\nDecorate your colony to make it into a pleasurable space.\nDig through snow, weather storms, and fight fires.\nCapture refugees or prisoners and turn them to your side or sell them into slavery.\nDiscover a new generated world each time you play.\nBuild colonies in the desert, jungle, tundra, and more.\nLearn to play easily with the help of an intelligent and unobtrusive AI tutor.\nRimWorld is a story generator. It’s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller. There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax.\nYour colonists are not professional settlers – they’re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew.\nEach person’s background is tracked and affects how they play. A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill – but he does that very well.\nColonists develop - and destroy - relationships. Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound.\nThe game generates a whole planet from pole to equator. You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert plain, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.\nYou can tame and train animals. Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.\nPeople in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.\nWounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities. Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous.\nYou can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent. A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs.\nAnd there's much more than that! The game is easy to mod and has an active mod community. Read more at http://rimworldgame.com.\n(All non-English translations are made by fans.)",

The game is physics-based, so the player can't win by just dropping the blocks in a random manner. Several in-game events are present, for example, the blocks may drop faster or become slippery. Sometimes the blocks even double in size. You play as a wizard that competes against other wizards and has to build his tower as tall and stable as possible. \n\nIt is possible to cast spells that either assist the players or make the building harder for other wizzards. The players can use 17 spells Throughout a match. Light magic spells are used for making the gameplay easier for the player while Dark magic spells make it harder for your opponents to progress. \n\nThree game modes are present: Race, Puzzle, and Survival.

In this mode, you need to perform different tricks in a limited time period, such as drifting, jumping or spinning around. Gymkhana rounds are unskippable to progress in the career mode. Another key feature that highlights DiRT 3 is flashbacks - the mechanics that allows turning back time if you made a mistake during the race and driving a certain piece of the track again.",

    "description": "The direct sequel to Shank (2010). The main protagonist, Shank, is a former mafia hitman. His home country is taken over by a military coup led by ruthless General Magnus, and Shank has no choice but to fight the regime's militia. There's also a second protagonist, Shank's childhood friend Corina. She can be played in several story missions, as well as in a newly introduced multiplayer survival mode. Corina's abilities are slightly different from that of Shank's, her moves are swifter, however, her attacks deal less damage.\n\nThe game is played as a 2D side-scroller. To move forward, Shank and Corina have to defeat all enemies they encounter, using three types of weapons: piercing them with knives, smashing with a club or shooting with a gun. The weapons can be switched on a fly during the action, thus allowing a variety of combos. The gameplay has slightly changed since the original game: blocking is not allowed anymore, and dodging is the only option to evade damage. Like its predecessor, Shank 2 features a somewhat cartoonish visual style, that contrasts the quite bloody and grotesque action scenes.",

This part of the series has street racing as its main theme. \n\n###Gameplay\nThe game includes 34 cars divided by three types: \"derby\", \"race\" and \"street\". As the player's career progresses, he or she can unlock more cars that include everything up to school buses. Each car has its unique characteristics and may require different driving styles. The player can also upgrade his or her existing vehicle instead of purchasing a new one.\n\nIn the career mode, the game includes more than 30 tracks with varied environment and length. The levels often allow more than one route to choose from at any lap. AI-controlled opponents have personalities that define their driving style. Besides the races, there are mini-games that offer the player to perform stunts.\n\n###Differences from the original game\nCompared to the first part, the sequel doubled on the number of available cars, tracks, and mini-games. FlatOut 2 also introduced longer tournaments and online multiplayer. There's also an improved physics engine. The tire grip was enhanced, making the controls more sturdy, and the cars are now less likely to bounce off the track.\n\nThere's also a ragdoll physics model that defines the movements of the driver within the car. After crashes and during the stunt mini-games the driver may even fly out of the car. In some mini-games, the goal is to throw the driver's body as far as possible or to land it on a designated target.",

Shank uses three types of weapons: a firearm, a melee weapon, such as a chainsaw, and two daggers. All three should be used interchangeably to create a variety of combo movements, which are essential to master before you reach the late stages of the game. Enemy attacks can be dodged or blocked. Shank can also perform a number of acrobatic tricks and other movements, such as throwing enemies or jumping on them, which makes for a varied gameplay.",

It is the sixth main installment in the series.\n\n###Story\nThe game takes place six months after the events of Conviction. The Third Echelon got disbanded, and Sam Fischer became a private security contractor. A terrorist organization known as The Engineers threatens the United States with a series of terrorist attacks if the U.S. Military will not call off their troops stationed in other countries. POTUS comes to Fischer, forms the Fourth Echelon and grants Sam with a Fifth Freedom - the freedom to defend the four first freedoms no matter what it takes.\n\n###Gameplay\nSplinter Cell Blacklist focuses on a stealth mission approach. The player is still free to go in loud, but it will be much harder, as Fischer can sustain a very small amount of damage even on the lowest difficulty.\n\nThe players have a wide range of gadgets at their disposal, such as the snake cam, a throwable sticky camera that can distract enemies, a portable EMP, and a variety of grenades. It is also possible to upgrade Fisher's outfit, making it more stealthy or improve its armor. The players can also upgrade their HQ to gain certain advantages on the battlefield, such as an improved minimap.\n\nThe game evaluates the players' performance. Three play styles are available - Ghost, a complete stealth approach with no kills; Panther - a stealthy approach with enemy kills; Assault - a head-on gunfight with the enemies.",

The combat system is almost the same as it was in the second game. The player still has two weapons (one main and one temporary) and can perform combos. For the first time in the series, the Prince does not have his swords, and a dagger is used instead (replaced with the Dagger of Time later). The temporary weapons now have a certain amount of damage they can sustain. \n\nThe Prince can now transform into a Dark Prince, whose health goes down quickly, but can be instantly regenerated with sand.

Your class (warrior, paladin, or magician) is assigned automatically based on your actions in the tutorial mission. There are also dialogues, character interaction, and even romance options than allow your character to marry and have children. The player explores the world’s map in real time, like in most RPGs. The combat system, however, is completely different. During battles, the player controls not the hero, but the hero's units, the number of which depends on the character’s “Leadership”.

All other characters, including the protagonists’ wife Esther, are only mentioned by the narrator and do not appear in the game. There's very little actual gameplay, and your goal as a player is to explore the island and discover as many parts of the backstory as possible. The goal of the game is to follow the story, immerse yourself in the experience and pass it through your emotions.\n\nDear Esther is famous for its visual design and sound: there are gorgeous natural landscapes (the caves in particular), ambient sounds, and music.

Their quest is to find the Guardians of Light. Meanwhile, King Mickey and Riku are searching for those who previously owned the Keyblades. The common goal of the characters is to prevent a new Keyblade War that villainous Master Xehanort is trying to trigger.

However, other characters can join him to form a party. The party can have a maximum of five characters at once.

The game uses basics from the hack-and-slash genre, like its predecessor, and was developed by Santa Monica studio, which is a subsidiary of Sony Entertainment. The game is recognized as one of the best for the console from Sony and the best game in action genre in 2007. The game was released on Sony Playstation 2 already at the moment when the third version of the console was already selling for four months. The developers explained their decision: one hundred million people already playing on PlayStation 2, whereas on the next-generation console gamers were just going to adopt the new hardware.\n\n###Key features\nThe player controls Kratos, who in the first part killed the god of war Ares and took his place. The game heavily relies on the ancient Greek mythology and uses it as inspiration and the main source for enemies and NPC design as well as locations design. However, the game is not a great source of accurate historical facts: Ancient Greece history was rewritten for the sake of the genre and the game universe, the rules of which were established in the first part.\n\n###The story\nKing of the gods Zeus betrays Kratos and kills him, but the Spartan is saved from the Underworld by another goddess Gaia, who invites Kratos to find the Sisters of Fate and go to the past and prevent his own murder. The gameplay remained the same: the player can use several attacks, which can be combined and improved with the help of the in-game currency collected from enemies. The game has a lot of Quick-Time-Events, mostly they are used in battles with bosses and in finishing combo-moves. Bosses in the game, in comparison with the first part, significantly increased.",

Many years later, Earth is inhabited by the mutated creatures that look like combinations of humans with other animals and things.

Planetary Annihilation gameplay is largely similar to classic RTS series like Starcraft or Command & Conquer, yet not without its own unique features. This game is focused on interplanetary wars on a larger scale and allows its players to conquer the whole worlds or even destroy them using nukes and Death Star-like devices. The maps are randomly generated, and each map constitutes a whole planet in 3D projection (albeit scaled down). Each player starts with a Commander unit that is used to create necessary buildings. Commanders represent the player and, like in chess, loss of your Commander means losing the game.\n\nThe definitive feature of the game is that battles are not contained to certain planets, but are fought across the whole planetary systems using missiles and \"planet thrusters\"; and there are many such systems in the galaxy. The scale of the setting can make it difficult to keep track of one's operations across different systems at the later stages of the game.",

Later, in August 2015, it was released on consoles of the next generation - PS4 and Xbox One.\n\n###The setting\nThe action takes place in a city called New York Zero, where an epidemic is raging, and its territory is divided into zones. The player will try on the role of Sergeant James Heller, who serves in the Middle East. It all begins at the moment when his wife calls and says that the epidemic has begun again in the city and they are at the epicenter with their daughter. Returning home, James discovers that his family is dead and now his task is to find someone who, in his opinion, is the culprit of these deaths.\n\n###Key features\nCruel and bloody Prototype 2 is the second game of the series. It seems that, compared to the first part, the gory feel is becoming bigger. The game is allowing you to run and jump almost anywhere and do whatever the player wants - anarchy! But despite the fact that the game takes place in an open world, a player can feel some linearity of events. According to lead designer Matt Armstrong, this was done purposefully so that the player would feel the development of the storyline and wouldn’t be afraid of too many options, and have the opportunity to open new territories gradually, thereby more effectively upgrading his character and immerse in the game’s universe.",

The game represents a unique and unforgettable experience as it transports players in a weird town which crouches, ominous, in the far reaches of an ancient steppe. It was once a small drover settlement, huddled around a monstrous abattoir—but something about the butchery it was near has changed it. It has developed an odd social structure over the course of several generations. It could have quietly continued along its weird way, but a sudden outbreak of an unknown and inevitably lethal disease has decimated the citizens. Prayers did not help. Science did not help. So, finally, they have turned to outsiders for help: three of them enter the town in hope of finding a cure or—failing that—an explanation. The first outsider was a ruthless investigator, assigned by local authorities. The second is a far-sighted Ripper who has used his extraordinary abilities to gain a reputation as an ingenious surgeon, who has come to the town in search of his father's terrible heritage. The third—and last—outsider is an eccentric girl rumored to have mystic healing abilities; she may become the town's salvation were it not for the constant fear that plagues her, the memory of the horrors of her recent past.\r\nOn the surface, Pathologic is a first person horror adventure game where you control one of three \"heroes.\" Dig deeper, however, and you’ll find an experience that will affect your emotional and psychological state. In the world of Pathologic you’ll find yourself in situations where morals and good deeds are meaningless in the face of raw despair and endless need. Talk to the denizens of the town and decide for yourself if you wish to ease someone else’s pain or save every bit of precious medicine to protect yourself from the invisible and inexorable plague. Become witness to the miasma of horror as the plague begins to overcome the town.\r\nBrand New in-house English script: For the first time ever, the game has cast off the major issue that had previously disallowed international audiences from accessing it.\r\nBrand New Voice-overs.\r\nNew content: A certain amount of text that had previously been cut from the international version of the game have now been restored\r\nUpdated textures and higher resolutions support.\r\nNew visual effects.Newly Included Fan-Made Polish translation: thanks to the hard work and generosity of Jakub Derdziak & Aldona Derdziak.\r\nAn Italian translation, kindly donated to us by the original translators of the game, Stefano Gaburri and Claudio Todeschini.\r\nAn indie cult classic.\r\n12 days in a plague-ridden town.

As time goes by, more and more things happen, inviting you to participate and change the course of events.\r\n3 playable characters with 3 unique storylines. The Bachelor’s, the Haruspex’s, and the Changeling’s plots are interconnected, but every side of the trilemma is represented separately via unique events, quests, dialogues, and subplots.\r\nThe plot is critically acclaimed and often regarded as the high point of the game. It’s not just about the fate of the dying town—it’s about an ideological conflict, represented by a multitude of characters and factions, each with their own idea of what life, death, and miracles are.\r\nAn open-world game. While the plot is there to grab you, the town has no artificial boundaries: you are free to explore it from day one, carving out your own story.\r\nSurvival is tough.

    "description": "In the fourth part of Bit.Trip series the player controls Commander Video, a small featureless character, as he runs eternally to the right through a pixelated landscape. He jumps and slides to evade dangers, such as giant caterpillars, angry trees or soaring fireballs, and kicks to attack them. He has no hit points, and any hit means you have to restart the level again. Commander Video always runs, the player cannot stop or reverse the movement and is only able to make the character perform certain actions, such as jumps, at the necessary moments. \nCommander Video's movements are perfectly synchronized to music. When movements are performed right, new notes are added to the game's chiptune music score. Even pushing an unassigned button will result in playing some musical sounds. The run becomes quicker with time, raising the game's difficulty, but also giving the player more control and influence over the soundtrack. The game's visual style is that of simple and colorful pixel art with a \"retro\" feel to it. There are three “worlds” in the game, each of them includes eleven levels and ending with a boss fight.",

The original game was a Super Mario rip-off, but, though the new game retained many of the old mechanics (such as defeating enemies by jumping on them), there are also novel gameplay ideas.\nYou play as Giana, a girl who tries to rescue her sister Maria from the hands of an evil dragon Gurglewocky. Giana herself has two different personalities, a \"Cutie\" and a \"Punk\", that can be switched during the game. This change also dramatically alters the environment, allowing the player to shift between two dream worlds: one is a brightly colored garden, while other is a dark, nightmarish forest of giant mushrooms. In both worlds, the levels are nearly identical, despite the aesthetic change. But sometimes the game may demand you to switch to another world to move forward or to obtain a powerup that only exists in one of the worlds.\nA definitive feature of Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams is its music. The score was composed by Chris Hulsbeck, who worked with the original Giana Sisters, and metal band Machinae Supremacy. The soundtrack shifts between “traditional” and \"heavy\" versions of the same compositions to highlight the game's dual nature.",

    "description": "The Sims 3 is the third part of its series. Like all Sims game, it allows the player to control the life of a person or even a whole family.\n\n###Character creation\nBefore the main game starts, the player has to create his or her character, called sim. The player can choose to play as a single character or a family. The game allows full customization for each sim. The player chooses their gender, age, race, and body type, as well as their traits that influence the sim's in-game behavior. The traits help sims to learn new skills that will be useful in their job and social life. The player can also choose to set all settings to random. There are also settings that define if the sims will age, and how fast.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game introduces the open world that lives on its own even when the player doesn't interfere. Unlike in Sims 2, the world is seamless and there's no long load time when you travel it. The sims themselves became more independent and require less player attention to stay alive. Sims 3 is less oriented towards \"tamagotchi\"-like life-sustaining and more towards actually living the sims' lives, such as going to work, attending parties, making friends and flirting. The sims will occasionally have wishes, and fulfilling them earns the character more happiness points.\n\n###Building homes\nThe building mode didn't change much since Sims 2, but the game introduced a few additional options. Most notably, elements don't have to be aligned to a grid anymore. The player can place them diagonally at any angle.",

    "description": "In a one-color world, one scholar, working in one of the universities, suddenly discovers the phenomenon of color. But where she works, nobody needs her discovery. And even worse - the scientist is expelled from the university. At the same time, the color discovered by this scientist is spreading in her one-color world. In punishment, the scientist is sent to another world - the world of impossible flowers. Impossible colors are those colors that are invisible to the human eye, they are outside the visible spectrum.\n\nThe player plays for a little boy named Hue, who one morning wakes up and starts looking for eight visible сolors to save the scientist from the world of invisible colors.\n\n###Game mechanics based on color\nIn the game, objects can be seen, but with them you can do something only if the color of these objects is different from the color of the game's background. For example, you start with a black background, and you can see a black door on a black background - you can see its outline. But you can open it only if you change its color to some other one. or if you change the background color. And you can change the background color only when you find, \"open\" some color. For example, the first color to open in the game is Aqua. After you open this color, you can make this color the background color of the game. And then the door will be black and you will be able to open it. This technique is used in many games - but usually it is implemented only for one color, for example, white on black or vice versa. In Hue, the player deals with eight colors - after the opening of each next color, the game is correspondingly more complicated.\n\nThere are many objects in the game that you need to interact with in order to go further. And each object has to be made real by using the color mechanics described above. And also find a way to properly interact with the object itself. There are many puzzles in the game, and often they seem to be unresolved, but after the decision is finally found, the player is usually surprised how he could not see this decision from the very beginning.\n\n###The Mysteries of the Final\nIn addition to the fascinating mechanics, the game also has a story - a story about a woman researcher who discovered color for a one-color world. This story develops throughout the game, its fragments open gradually and in the end everything will turn into one picture.",

Its approach to the storytelling is typical for tabletop RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons. \nYou play cards against the Dealer, who is both your DM, opponent, and narrator of your adventures. Each card represents an item, a character, or an encounter. You navigate your character through the story that unfurls as you reveal the cards and make your choices. The goal is to collect a powerful deck of cards that give your character better weapons, armor, and other equipment. You can unlock more cards after you defeat bosses and complete quests. The Dealer’s goal is to hamper your progress, as he plays his cards to put new obstacles in your way.\nMost of the time the game will only show you the cards and the Dealer who sits across the table from you. You will learn the events from listening to him and reading the text on cards. Battles, however, are actually fought in real time by animated characters on visualized 3D arenas. This is very unusual for board game simulators and brings some variety into the gameplay.",

The main character, an elusive thief Garrett, is tasked with resolving a crisis brewing in the metropolitan City. Different factions fight for influence and schemes are put into action to undermine each other’s plans. As the story progresses, the protagonist finds more clues about the mysterious prophecy that tells about the end of humanity and risks his own life to prevent it from fulfilling.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game heavily emphasizes discreteness and stealth, as the guards of the City may often try to stop the main character. Visibility and sounds play a crucial role in completing different tasks, and utilizing the surroundings can help get rid of enemies without confrontation. Different gadgets can be used to mask the sounds, obtain enemy’s location, and snuff out the lights. However, the playable character can still use his weapons to get rid of pursuers, but on higher levels of difficulty, doing so ends up in defeat and the need to restart the mission.\n\n###Visuals and features\nAs with its predecessor, Thief II employs a refined AI system, where enemies can notice sudden changes in the environment and react correspondingly. The lighting and shadowing have also been revamped, albeit keeping the same noir mood to the locations. The graphics of the game are awe-inspiring for its year of release, as each texture is highly detailed, and physics are made to be life-comparable realistic.",

The game uses the top-down third-person view. The player controls his or her character with the use of a keyboard (for movement) and a mouse (for aiming). \n\nThe central part of each server is Nexus, a safe zone in which the players can trade. From Nexus they teleport to various realms where they receive quests that involve killing monsters. When they kill enough monsters, they may encounter a boss, and eventually Oryx himself.\n\n###Characters\nThere are fifteen character classes, but the new player has to start with only Wizard class available. Other classes that include Ninja, Samurai, Paladin, and Assassin, among others, will be eventually unlocked when the player gains more experience. \n\nAn unusual feature of the Realm of the Mad God is the permanent death. When the player's character is killed, he or she will not respawn. All equipment of the dead character is also lost.",

The primary goal of a team or a player is to eliminate the opponent(s). To achieve this goal, one must utilize a various range of weapons.

Amy Ferrier is hired by the corporation that operates the station to investigate a mysterious chain of events occurred on the station and to retrieve a processing module from the station's artificial intelligence. Upon her arrival, Amy begins to find out what's going on using Tacoma's augmented reality system.\n\n###Gameplay\nTacoma focuses on the in-game world's exploration. There are no enemies present in the game, so the players can focus on the narrative aspect of it. \n\nThe players utilize an augmented reality device found on the station to access its security footage and recreate the events that happened here. It is possible to manipulate the footage like a recording, fast-forwarding it, pausing and rewinding. The players can see the characters move from room to room, or in some cases follow the character's path. One of the main game's aspects is its puzzles, as it is the main thing the players will be doing for most of the time.",

Delivering a fresh new take on the Narrative Adventure, your choices and character growth truly matter. Make hard-hitting decisions, but also develop an array of skills to directly impact how the story unfolds. With permanent, long-lasting consequences, there is no going back. Plunge into a tale of intrigue and manipulation in the style of a classic murder mystery, living with a cast of alluring characters each hiding their own dark secrets. Trust no one while uncovering dire truths – no matter the cost to mind and body.\nThe Council begins in 1793, with players taking the role of secret society member Louis de Richet after his invitation to a private island off the shores of England by the enigmatic Lord Mortimer. Joining him are a number of high profile guests, including Napoleon Bonaparte and President of the newly-formed United States of America, George Washington. The strange nature of this private reception goes beyond just the prestigious guests –Richet’s own mother has recently gone missing on the island, while each and every one of the colorful cast seems to have their own hidden agendas.\nIn a new twist for the genre, the core of The Council’s gameplay comes from manipulating and maneuvering through character encounters using the unique Social Influence system. During confrontations, skills and limited resources can be used to gain the upper hand and achieve the desired outcome. Players will be rewarded for their knowledge of each character’s psychological vulnerabilities and immunities, as well as their preparations made during prior exploration and investigation. Failing an encounter does not mean ‘game over’, and no action can be taken back. The consequences are permanent, and may result in persistent physical disfigurements or mental traits that help or hinder the rest of the player’s adventure.\nRichet’s numerous skills can be developed to align with your chosen approach to the adventure. Solve issues with diplomacy, delve into occultism to expand your historical and scientific knowledge, or play detective and see what others do not perceive. Your skills will have uses that extend far beyond your conversations with fellow guests. With 15 diverse skills to use and invest in, players are free to uncover The Council’s mysteries how they see fit, with wildly varying consequences depending on their methods. The results will forever alter the life of Louis de Richet, of those around him, and shape history as we know it.",

Once again, the player controls Rufus, a selfish yet loveable rogue, who tries to leave his home planet Deponia and move to the luxurious space station Elysium. His cyborg girlfriend Goal got into trouble because of Rufus’s faults, and he has to save her. The plot, character interactions, and many jokes rely on the assumption that the player is already familiar with most characters from Deponia. However, in case you didn’t play the original game, there’s an introduction to familiarize you.\nChaos on Deponia uses point-and-click controls, which are usually better suited for mouses and keyboards. However, the developers claim to make sure that playing with a console’s controller is just as fluid and natural. The analog stick stands in for the mouse, while the buttons control various actions Rufus can do to objects and other characters. Like in most adventure games, the protagonist has to use various items to solve puzzles. Those are quite complex right from the start, and there’s no growing difficulty over the course of Chaos on Deponia.",

Those who are already lost may find their way to a secret highway winding through underground caves. The people who live and work along this highway are themselves a little strange at first, but soon seem familiar: the aging driver making the last delivery for a doomed antique shop; the young woman who fixes obsolete TVs surrounded by ghosts; the child and his giant eagle companion; the robot musicians; the invisible power company lurking everywhere, and the threadbare communities who struggle against its grip.\n\nKENTUCKY ROUTE ZERO is a magical realist adventure game in five acts, featuring a haunting electronic score, and a suite of hymns and bluegrass standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers. Rendered in a striking visual style that draws as much from theater, film, and experimental electronic art as it does from the history of videogames, this is a story of unpayable debts, abandoned futures, and the human drive to find community.\n\nOriginally published episodically over a span of years, the game now includes all five acts along with the \"interludes,\" which were originally published separately. It has also been painstakingly localized for French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Spanish (both European Spanish and Latin American).",

Your goal is to navigate it through the dangerous 2D space, avoid asteroids and fight off enemy ships and space monsters. Every time the ship hits an object, it loses some of its health. \nThe spaceship contains several devices, such as thrusters, laser cannons, and deflector shields, and one character can only control one device at a time. To keep the ship running and safe, the protagonists have to constantly move around the ship to activate a certain device. This is why, although Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime can also be played alone, the game is strongly oriented towards the cooperative multiplayer. Up to four players can participate and form a crew to thoroughly control every device. Even in the single-player mode, there’s the second protagonist, presumably your character's lover, who is controlled by the AI and obeys your orders. \nPink-colored surfaces, gigantic hearts that need to be unchained, and other visual elements highlight the game’s underlying theme of love as the means to survive. The game’s visuals are colorful, albeit simple, and are based on the “superflat” art style.",

The name of the game is a pun on Sergio Leone's famous western movie A Fistful of Dollars.\n\n###Weapons\nThe game offers a variety of XIX century weapons. In Fistful of Frags, there are five weapon classes (melee, pistols, rifles, shotguns, and special) and several weapon tiers. The lowest tier is Starter Weapons, the ones the player gets when he or she spawns. There are Blue, Red, and Gold weapons that the player can find in the chests of the respective color. Different weapons allow different actions, such as dual wielding or throwing. There's a weight limit that doesn't allow the player to carry too many weapons at once. The way the player obtains the weapons strongly depends on the mode.\n\n###Game modes\nFistful of Frags includes multiple game modes, both single and multiplayer, cooperative and competitive. In the Team Shootout mode, the players are divided into 4 or 2 teams and eliminate each other trying to get the most frags. When spawning, the player can obtain additional weapons, spending his or her \"stars\". Break Bad mode is similar, but the goal of each team is to gather more money. The guns are also purchased with the in-game money. There are also Versus, Elimination, Shootout, and Teamplay modes.",

The game resembles an online chat using an EOL messaging client running on an operating system that closely resembles Windows XP. There are multiple pop-culture references to the early 2000s era, such as the user profile icons, that resemble multiple old memes (like the Polish Polka), the icons on the main character's desktop that show that he is a fan of 28 Days Later, Lord of The Rings, and Red Hot Chili Peppers. \n\nAs the game goes on, the players are able to change their profile icon according to the tendencies of these years. It is also possible to interact not only with Emily, but also with their classmates, and the main player's friends. The main gameplay revolves around chatting with emilyluv (she will later change her nickname to emerly). You discuss your high school love with her and your classmate Brad that harasses Emily. It turns out that your other classmate, Travis, is planning a party, which the players can choose to attend with Emily or stay at home.",

It is loosely based on the famous horror story by H. P. Lovecraft and the Cthulhu Mythos universe in general.\n\n###Plot\nThe game is set in 1924 in Massachusetts, USA. The main character is Edward Pierce, a troubled and alcoholic private detective. He was hired to investigate the mysterious fire that destroyed the Hawkins mansion on the Darkwater Island and killed the Hawkins family. Shortly before the fire, the mother of the family drew an image of a weird monster. Pierce's investigation eventually leads him to discover the secret cult of the ancient evil god Cthulhu, who is about to awaken to unleash his rage on Earth. The protagonist faces cosmic horrors, unholy cultists, weird dimensions, and otherworldly creatures that make him question his own sanity.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player controls Edward Pierce and navigates him across the Darkwater Island. The goal is to investigate the case by talking to other characters, searching for clues and exploring the environment. The protagonist is weak and cannot really fight a strong opponent, so the player has to find the ways to avoid trouble. Another major concern in the game is sanity. Encountering eldritch abominations and uncovering dark secrets can drive Edward insane. His mental state affects the gameplay.",

The game is set in a fictional world 20 years after its predecessor,  following new story, new possibilities and new threats for the world.\n\nThe game’s main character, a paladin in servitude to the Divine, is forced to be joined with a death knight, his ideological nemesis. The main story is focused around their unwanted bond, and the game employs various mechanics regarding the control of two characters. Role-playing elements will allow the players to create a unique path for deuteragonists, and to find different ways to defeat their enemies. The game features lots of dialogue filled with witty humor, reflecting on the situation that our characters are in.\n\nDespite game’s premise of a simple hack-and-slash adventure RPG, the problematic caverns and long dungeons will provide a great sense of challenge even to the veterans of the genre, as the game punishes every mistake that the player makes. However, considering the astonishing soundtrack and overall setting of the game, the difficulties can be set aside, as the game will allow the players to immerse in the journey truly.",

When his homeland was attacked by pirates, Otus starts an adventure to protect his home and reveal the secrets of his race. He makes new friends on the way. Each of them has special powers, useful during fights.\n\nOwlboy features classic platforming gameplay with a twist: unlike in many hardcore games of this genre, here you can fly and have almost no chance to die by falling. Otus can pick things up and use them as weapons or to solve puzzles. There are several ways to complete the same missions; your choice depends on your imagination only. Also, there are suitable tactics for different enemy types: while you can defeat some of them with direct force, the others can be destroyed in more creative ways.\n\nThe game’s world is organized like a huge cylinder with Otus’ village on the bottom; during the game you will fly higher and higher. Missions are set in separate locations; after completing them you will return to the central hub to get new quests.",

According to the idea, the player soon learns that the machine is infected with a certain demon, which captures the souls of players.\n\n###Key features\nThe main character gets help from the soul of a player already captured: he could not cope with the devil's trials. Pony Island is a point-and-click game that simulates the operating system using the user interface. The main task of the player is to study the internal software shell of the gaming machine, where he got stuck and tried to escape the demon. The gameplay of the game changes constantly and the player needs to participate in mini-games like endless runner and shoot-em-up.\n\n###Money for the dream\nPrior to Pony Island, Daniel Mullins was already trying to release the game: right after college, in 2014, he collected the necessary money to develop his first game Catch Monsters. The successful crowdfunding experience allowed Daniel to pursue his dream and not work on boring work in the office. Pony Island was developed in just 48 hours, during the Ludum Game Jam, and later appeared on the platform for indie games Steam Greenlight. After that, the popular YouTube PewDiePie recorded and published a let's play of the game, after which the game gained enough votes, and a full release happened.",

Uncle helps repel the attack.\n\nAnd then the representative of the rebels of the IRIS Network begins to contact Jade, and says that Alpha Sections does not protect the planet from aliens, but, on the contrary, in every possible way contributes to the final defeat.\n\nJade begins to act as a photojournalist, collect materials to expose Alpha Sections.\n\nFurther, there are many events in the game and several completely unexpected twists, revealing both Jade's special abilities and her very special origin and purpose.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe basis of the gameplay - solving puzzles and riddles, finding the right directions and finding the right buttons to open the doors.\n\nMany tasks are impossible without a partner. There are several partners in the game, and they can not only help with puzzles, but also take part in battles.\n\nWhen encountering enemies, Jade fights with Daï-jo's staff. Subsequently, she acquires weapons capable of hitting targets at a distance.\n\nTo move, Jade uses hovercraft, which can be improved, both in terms of movement and in terms of weapons - hovercraft also has it.\n\nJade is constantly taking pictures.

The player controls the soldier Bitterman.\n\nDespite the similarities in weapons and objects, the enemies and the storyline have nothing in common.\n\nInitially, the creators did not plan to call the game Quake, but due to the fact that many of the names that came to their mind were already used somewhere, they had to dwell on the old name. In addition, their decision was also influenced by the fact that by the time Quake, as a trademark, was able to ensure commercial success.\n\nQuake IV (2005)\nThe game continues the story of the battle of humanity with the Stroggs. Spaceships and military equipment of earthlings borrowed from the movie \"Star Troopers\", and the overall design of the Stroggs and their equipment (especially living computers with human body parts) is made in the style of Giger's biomechanoids.\n\nThe player acts as a paratrooper of Rhino squad involved in a counterattack on the capital planet of the Stroggs.\n\nAfter Quake IV were created:\nEnemy Territory: Quake Wars (2007) is a game in the world of Quake II and Quake IV, events take place 50 years before the events of Quake II.

The player is given some two-dimensional background with clickable items on it and the characters on the screen. The player may interact either with the environment or with the people. The remastered version also brought touch controls for mobile devices and accelerometer Wii Remote pads. \r\n\r\n###Director's Cut features\r\nThe game's graphics were rendered in higher definition, some of the original's scenes were cut out, and the display of the blood spilling in some scenes was evaded entirely. The original game featured only George Stobbart as the protagonist; however, the whole new Collard's story was added. The game has also got easier — the \"help\" section was added.",

    "description": "The fifth part in the Total War series, Empire is set in the 18th century. The player controls over one of the powerful empires of the era, such as Great Britain, Spain or Russia. There are more than 50 factions in the game overall, although only the major civilizations are playable, while the rest are campaign-specific minor states and colonies. The factions are not static, as colonies can claim independence, and within empires, the government can change, even in the one controlled by the player. \nUnlike its predecessors, Empire: Total War puts a stronger emphasis on the empire-building in the vein of Civilization series. The game combines turn-based global strategy with an RTS-style warfare. On the strategic map, you control your empire’s diplomacy, economy, religion, colonization, government, and other aspects. The battles, however, are fought as real-time wargames. The warfare is very realistic and includes a variety of units and battle movements based on military history. The units react like real people, shoot orders, and panic if they lose. Empire was also the first game in the series to introduce fully realized naval battles, which allow you to set enemy ships on fire or to board and capture them in real-time.",

Unfortunately, due to an accident, the professor dies and Lara has to return to Great Britain. 15 years later, Lara opens up an Egyptian tomb where an ancient Egyptian god Set was buried. She incidentally awakens an old god, so now Lara has to get him back to the tomb to prevent the Apocalypse from happening.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe main gameplay formula of Tomb Raider is largely the same. The players have to explore the levels in order to find certain items. In their search, the players have to avoid and fight enemies and use aerobatics to progress further into the level.\n\nHowever, compared to the last game, The Last Revelation features some major gameplay changes. Now Lara can swing on ropes to get over gaps and pits, she can use pipes to climb up the buildings, and shimmy on ledges. Instead of using the old circular inventory system, it is now linear, where all the items in your inventory are placed in a horizontal line. The players can now utilize a compass, yet it is only used for putting in cheat codes or solving a puzzle on one of the game's levels. The items in your inventory can be combined together.",

There are a lot of locations to explore in the game. It depends on the player - exactly how to proceed - constantly using new bodies or to save money and after death to resurrect your favorite body. Note that it is very easy to die in this game. As for the goal - the player has to climb the tower, where at the very top lies the key to saving the whole world. There are more than forty floors in this tower. But this is only part of the story.\r\n\r\n###Change of plans\r\nInitially, the game supposed to be called Lily Bergamo, but at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014 conference, the name was changed to LET IT DIE. The development lasted no less than three and a half years. Also, the release date was unknown at some point, but developers managed to deliver.

The protagonist will perform a number of stealth military operations in Philippines’ jungle and in the highland of Tibet. There are also playable flashbacks about Anderson’s experiences during the Bosnian conflict that provide more details about his past with Merinov.\n\n###Gameplay\nJust like its name suggests, the game puts a strong emphasis on sniping. There are many mechanics that aim to make the marksmanship realistic. Each bullet’s trajectory strongly depends on the wind and distance to the target. There’s a HUD that displays the intensity and direction of the wind, allowing the player to aim better. A red dot indicates where the bullet will hit, though this can be disabled in a higher difficulty level. The character’s physical state also influences his accuracy, and after running, he has to rest for a while before shooting. Stealth is also a vital component of the gameplay. Anderson has to sneak past enemy soldiers and cannot survive an open encounter against multiple opponents.",

Your experience, however, remains in your pool of hunters—called your Bloodline—always.\nHIGH RISK, HIGH REWARD, HIGH TENSION\nHunt’s competitive, match-based gameplay mixes PvP and PvE elements to create a uniquely tense experience where your life, your character, and your gear are always on the line. At the beginning of each match, up to five teams of two set out to track their monstrous targets. Once they’ve found and defeated one of these they will receive a bounty—and instantly become a target for every other Hunter left on the map. If you don’t watch your back, you’ll find a knife in it, and your last memory will be of another team of Hunters walking away with your prize. The higher the risk, the higher the reward–but a single mistake could cost you everything.\nPROGRESSION\nEven in death, you will be able to progress among the ranks of Hunters via your Bloodline. Though one character may die, their experience will be transferred to your Bloodline, where it can be applied your other Hunters. If you make it off of the map alive, you will be able to use the money and experience you earn to kit out new Hunters and prepare for the next match. If you die, you lose everything but your experience.\nDARK SIGHT\nDark Sight allows Hunters to see into the veil between worlds, making that which cannot be seen by mortal eyes visible to those who have been initiated. Use Dark Sight when you are tracking monsters, and a ghostly light will guide you toward your next target.

    "description": "###The legacy\nThe original game was released for the Sega Genesis console with additional hardware that allowed the console from the late 80's to launch games on CD. From the point of view of gameplay, the game is not much different from other ones of the series of that time: it is a side-scrolling 2D platformer where the main goal of the player is to go as fast as possible. The game is often called the best in the series. In the development, it ought to be an improved version of the game Sonic The Hedgehog 2, but because of the low sales of the last, it was decided not to advertise connection between the two. Later the game was released on Sony PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube as part of the Sonic Gems Collection. The remastered version that uses a new engine was released for various platforms and mobile devices in 2011.\n\n###The plot\nThe plot of the game tells how Sonic goes to Never Lake, where the extraterrestrial body Little Planet appears at the end of the last month of each year. However, this time the main villain of the Sonic universe Dr. Robotnik tied the planet to the top of the mountain and began to transform its surface with the help of its robots into a huge factory. Sonic goes to the rescue to encounter not only Dr. Robotnik but also other characters in the series, such as Metal Sonic.\n\n###Key features\nThe gameplay of the game has not changed: Sonic must complete levels and defeat bosses at the end of each world. After collecting 50 rings, a special level becomes available, on which the player must destroy six UFOs. The version of the game for Steam includes the ability to play in 16: 9, leaderboards and a bunch achievements.",

In 2013, Valve allowed the team to publish the mod on Steam as a standalone modification.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe gameplay of Sven Co-op heavily resembles the same of the original Half-Life, so it is highly recommended to be familiar with its gameplay and to complete its tutorial level. Sven Co-op supports Half-Life's singleplayer but changes it up a bit to improve upon the cooperative aspect of the game.\n\nThe levels of Sven Co-op are divided into missions and are usually separated from each other. Many missions take place on several maps with some of them being fused into one. The objective of most levels is to find an exit or complete a specific task - it is not necessary to kill any enemies whatsoever. The maps are used using a variety of settings, starting with Black Mesa and ending with a modern urban war one.\n\n###Changes in comparison with the original game\nThere are only 12 changes in the original Half-Life gameplay, yet they do not drastically affect the gameplay. Most of the changes were made to the NPCs and the NPC following system. Now you can take any friendly NPC with you, some of the NPCs will even heal you. Several small changes also affect the enemy behavior, for example, the players can no longer free themselves from the barnacles. A teammate is needed to get you out.",

The game tells a story of the year 1943 and follows the story arc of the agent Blazkowicz and Agent One who infiltrated the Nazi base and found themselves captured and sent to the Castle Wolfenstein.

Although the title exploits the basic mechanics of shooting enemies and moving around the territory, the player is suggested with some firearms and tools. \nThere is a multiplayer which is based on a number of the quests and two teams set to accomplish them. The team who achieves the primary goal first wins. There are three modes: an objective, stopwatch, and checkpoint. Objective aims at the fulfilling the goal, and stopwatch controls the progress achieved within the period, and checkpoint fixes the progress at its milestones.",

There are five ammunition types, and many weapons share the ammo, so player often has to choose wisely. Mutations can be achieved through leveling up, with some available only to certain mutants, while others are free to choose from. Said mutations can emphasize on character’s unique skill, his weapon proficiency, or upgrade his stats.\n\n###Graphics and soundtrack\nThe game’s pixel art design is made very distinct and unique, as the setting of a post-nuclear western can lead to great possibilities for artists.

    "description": "Final Fantasy IX (ファイナルファンタジーIX, Fainaru Fantajī Nain) is a 2000 role-playing video game developed and published by Square for the PlayStation video game console. It is the ninth title in the main Final Fantasy series and the last to debut on the original PlayStation. The game plot centers on the consequences of a war between nations in a medieval fantasy world called Gaia. Players follow bandit Zidane Tribal, who kidnaps Alexandrian princess Garnet Til Alexandros XVII as part of a gambit by the neighboring nation of Lindblum. He joins Garnet and a growing cast of characters on a quest to take down her mother, Queen Brahne of Alexandria, who started the war. The plot shifts when the player learns that Brahne is a pawn of a more menacing threat, Kuja, who shares a mysterious history with Zidane spanning two worlds.\nThe game was developed alongside Final Fantasy VIII. Envisioned by developers as a retrospective for the series, it departed from the futuristic settings of Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII by returning to the medieval style of the first six installments. Consequently, it was influenced heavily by the original Final Fantasy game, and features allusions to the rest of the titles. Despite this approach, the game did introduce new features to the series, such as \"Active Time Event\" cutscenes, \"Mognet\", and unique equipment and skill systems.\nFinal Fantasy IX was released to critical acclaim. It is often cited by critics and fans as one of the best Final Fantasy titles, and holds the highest Metacritic score of the series. Final Fantasy IX was commercially successful, selling more than 5 million copies worldwide by March 2003 and 5.5 million copies by February 2016. It was re-released in 2010 as a PSOne Classic on the PlayStation Store; this version was compatible with PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable, and PlayStation Vita support arrived in 2012. In 2016, ports featuring minor gameplay and graphical enhancements were released for iOS, Android and Microsoft Windows followed by a port for PlayStation 4 in 2017.",

There is also a variation of the game called Uno Rush, announced two years later than the original.\n\n###Gameplay \nThe rules and card design do not differ from the original. Four players are sitting across the table.\nEvery player can check out his points in the composite chart. The round proceeds clockwise, it is supported by the revolving arrows and sound effects. The deck consists of 108 cards, 25 of each color. When it’s a player’s turn to go, he has to match the top card in the discard pile based on color, number or symbol of the card. They are dealt automatically to each player. It lets one focus on the game itself rather than on the mechanics.   \n\n###Key Features \nThe main visual appearance is a red screen and slow music so that the game screen can set up the background. There is not much action in the setting as the main processes appear between the players. Just like the original, one can’t see the opponents’ decks, so their goal is to become the first one to gain points. The player can also change the appearance in different game versions. For example, in Partner Uno the player with partners sit across from each other; the Xbox Live Version supports the webcams, which makes the action more intense. The video game has several teams over the internet, so it is possible to participate in live tournaments with players from around the world.",

In the Steam community, there are still enthusiastic nostalgic reviews of almost everything that concerns Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Chaos Theory. And there is an explanation for this. The game was released in 2005 and became the third in the Splinter Cell series. Canadian studio Ubisoft Montreal was engaged in the development, who is also responsible for Assassin's Creed and Far Cry. Critics and player noted the Xbox and PC versions of the game as the best. \n\n###The story\nIn Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, the player will feel like a professional spy, NSA agent Sam Fisher from a special unit called “The Third Echelon.” The plot takes its origin from the first game in the series. However, the narrative is constructed in such a way that the player does not necessarily have to go through it in order to enjoy the story. The events of the game occur in different parts of the Earth that are based on places from the real world. At the heart of the game is the conflict unfolding between China, North Korea, South Korea, and Japan.\n\nIn addition to a single user campaign, there is the possibility of playing on the net. However, the official online services for this game were disabled as early as August 2016. Despite this, players still have the opportunity to play on the local network or, with due skill - through third-party services.",

Online, estra and versus.\n\nNetwork mode tracks players with a legal copy of LL. This mode allows you to find an opponent with geolocation. Knowing the location of the proposed enemy, you can choose for the fight those whom you know.\n\nThe second option \"extra\" allows you to compete with the computer, improve your playing skills and the speed of reaction to the ball flying towards the face. Also this option allows you to pump your team, opening new skill levels and increasing the palette of skins.\n\nThe third option makes it possible to form teams for the game \"two vs two\", which gives dynamics to a murderous match.",

In this alternative 1960s England, conformity is key. You’ll have to fight or blend in with the drug-addled inhabitants, most of whom don’t take kindly to people who won’t abide by their not-so-normal rules.\nDiscover the retrofuturistic city’s dark history as you play through the intertwined narratives of three quietly rebellious citizens of Wellington Wells, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, as they face their pasts, prepare for the future, and engage in activities that aren’t exactly status quo in the artificially enthused society.\nSave 15% when you pre-purchase We Happy Few, and get instant access to the game's alpha. This allows you to experience the introduction to Arthur's narrative, explore a portion of the procedurally generated world, collect and craft items, and choose how you’ll interact with members of the Joy-obsessed society through stealth, combat, or conformity across a handful of the game’s unique events.\nPlus, get the exclusive in-game Jolly Brolly weapon at launch. There’s a definite chance of pain when using this weaponized umbrella, complete with advanced blocking capabilities and trippy psychedelic interior.\nRetrofuturistic 1960s England\nSet in retrofuturistic 1960s England, you will find a city ravaged by war and rebuilt by delusionally happy people. Everything appears joyful in Wellington Wells, including its roads, its people, and its omnipresent television personality: Uncle Jack! But, it’s actually a world on the brink of collapse. Come unveil its dark history, and discover how and why its residents came to be so beguilingly happy.\nThree Interwoven Narratives\nPlay as three flawed characters who explore their own connections to the events surrounding the rebuilding of Wellington Wells. They each have a unique storyline in which they interpret and react to the events around them in different ways. As you hide, conform, or fight back as each of them, you will encounter dark humour, a spot of hope, and even some redemption along the way.\nA Dystopia of Your Very Own\nIn We Happy Few, no two playthroughs are alike. While the citizens of Wellington Wells will always want to ensure that you’ve taken your Joy, the procedurally generated world will ensure that your experience with We Happy Few is different and unique.

The plot has four endings depending on your actions during the second part of the game.\n\nBoth the main game and its demo version are focused on atmosphere rather than on fights. You have almost no weapons and have to act stealthily. As the Beginning Hour is strictly time-limited it doesn’t feature many monsters or action scenes; the gameplay is based on exploration. The most frightening aspect of the game is its suspenseful atmosphere and the lack of knowledge about the house and its hosts.",

Their famous protagonists fight each other on an arena. In accordance with its name, the game is the “ultimate” installment of the series, in that it offers the players all the characters ever featured in Super Smash Bros. The game also introduces five new characters, most famously, Castlevania's Simon Belmont.\r\n\r\n###Gameplay\r\nUnlike most fighting games, Super Smash Bros. series is built around knocking opponents out of the arena rather than lowering their health bars. However, the damage meter increases the character's chances to be knocked out. Each fighter has a limited number of lives and loses one when he or she is knocked out. The player is eliminated when he or she loses all lives.\r\n\r\n###Multiplayer\r\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate includes several competitive multiplayer modes. Besides the traditional versus mode, there are several new modes not featured in the previous games. These include Tournament (the playoff mode for 32 players), Smash Squad (team multiplayer), Smashdown (a mode in which the defeated characters are eliminated).",

The developers got inspiration from other legendary games in the genre: attack set was borrowed from Street Fighter series and finishing moves from Mortal Kombat. In the reboot, the Combo Breaker mechanic has been changed a little - now it is necessary to coincide in strength and timing with a counter blow to make a successful break. The plot of the game almost wholly repeats the plot of the first part: each fighter passes the way in a tournament organized by a mega-corporation and fights with the final Fulgore boss. The details of the story are different for each character.\r\n\r\nYou can fight for 20 stages with a dynamically changing environment and destructibility. Besides, the game has all the fighters from the previous parts. The plot campaign with cinematic cut scenes will have to be done alone.

Also, there is a superiority mode, which requires the players to win, if they eliminate all foes’ vehicles and gain 1000 win points. Capturing points can earn these points and destroying enemy equipment. There is a possibility to form platoons for two people and to join clans. Many mechanics are taken from the PC-version, for instance, the physics of damage. While moving along the hilly terrain, you can also notice such mechanisms: you can do drift, driving a portable tank on a high-speed. Each map consists of two starting points of the teams.

    "description": "The genre of this game is defined as stealth-action. However, its plot is very unusual, although it does not contradict such a definition of the genre.\n\n###Plot\nYour character is a person who is deadly tired of a very common problem: the neighbors who threw a noisy party, not taking into account that they do not live alone in the world.\n\nIn ordinary life, you usually silently endure or call the police. But in this game you should just kill everyone who has the imprudence to make noise. You can do it with a knife, and you can use other, very simple, improvised means. At first, you only have a knife, but over time, the tools appear more interesting.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game has ten unique levels. Some details of each level are generated randomly, so each game is somewhat different from the other.\n\nAfter loading the level of the hero finds himself standing in front of a building or a complex of buildings, where there is a party with the participation of about fifty people.\n\nIt is assumed that by this time your character is already quite angry. And now he faces only one simple task - to destroy all.\n\nThe character has the skills to work with a knife, can set a variety of different traps, use various items.\n\nThere are also obstacles in the game. For example, party members may call the police, there are guards in the building, and if you kill a police officer, FBI agents will arrive. There are also others who may suddenly appear.\n\n###Bonuses\nYour character is not always the same person. There are several characters in the game that you can become as you play. These characters are more capable of killing, among them there are ninja and even a policeman.\n\nYou may have allies, someone you can call for help.\n\nThere is also a spin-off simulation game titled Party Hard Tycoon.",

The prototype was later expanded with the help from Kickstarter.\n\nThe player's objective is to help a sleepwalker to safely get to his bed moving the objects in each level. The sleepwalker follows a distinct path. The players have to change this path and guide him in the right direction. The players have to be careful with their decisions as the sleepwalker can just walk off the level. Several entities can also prevent the sleepwalker from arriving at his destination. Most of these entities just block the path and have to be moved out of the way by the player.\n\nThe game features a surreal art style which is somewhat inspired by Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dali. There's also a small mix of the sixties inspired artwork which can be seen in the sleepwalker's outfit or simply the typography of the game.",

There are 20 additional steampunk levels available for players to complete, which even those who have never played bullet-hell will like.

This, in turn, would affect the outcome of further cases. However, with the cases not being firmly tied down together, the impact of player's mistakes is insignificant.

Enemy attacks, your ship’s fire, and power-ups are synchronized to the song and can be predicted if you remember the tune well. The difficulty is also dependent on music. A power ballad or an ambient piece will do for a slow, meditative play, while a trance or heavy metal composition will turn the game into madness.

They promise a \"fresh interpretation of the universe set in current times, not tied to any existing iteration of Batman in games, film, or comics». To preserve this freshness, the creators of the game begin their story about Batman a few years after Bruce Wayne became Batman - they claim that it gives them the opportunity to be flexible in describing the character; As a result, the player, according to the creators of the game, also receives a certain freedom, playing for Batman in the branching narrative, which the game offers.\n\nPlayer selection influences what happens in the game next.\nThe game includes situations where it is necessary to act quickly, as well as the investigation sequences. \n\n###Crowd play\nIn the games of the series there is also the so-called \"crowd play\", it allows the game to be watched by an audience who can participate in the decision-making process.",

    "description": "Hellpoint is a dark sci fi action RPG set in the aftermath of a massive quantum cataclysm. Every living being quickly lost their mind as their memories and bodies were merged with alternate versions of themselves from parallel universes. The accident also attracted entities of immense power that should have been left alone, in the depth of other dimensions.\nYou play as a mysterious nameless character whose intentions are entirely determined by your choices. You wake up in the derelict Irid Novo space station, in orbit around a super-massive black hole.\nIn the game, the space station orbits in real time around the ominous black hole. Its position in the sky directly impacts the sanity of the inhabitants of the station. The singularity is doing more than simply distorting the fabric of space and time; based on the time of the orbit, enemies in the levels get crazier or struck by fear, unknown entities roam the corridors and dozens of other mysterious events can occur.\nHellpoint is based on a peculiar structure called the Quantic System. It is a series of interconnected systems that are utilizing a server clock to decide when and where a particular dynamic event should occur. You can see a preview of that system in our demo linked below. You venture in a corridor that you previously walked through, and suddenly a new passage is opened. A tall menacing mini-boss is now patrolling where there was no one before. Enemies cower in fear as you approach them, or charge you in a fit of rage. A boss suddenly grows tougher and more aggressive, but also drops more valuable loot. It is up to you to figure out what events happen where and when so that you can exploit them to your advantage.\nIn Hellpoint, the Black Hole is truly the master of the dungeon.\nIrid Novo was once a shining beacon of intergalactic collaboration, built to research advanced artificial intelligence and quantum mechanics. Now, it is a dark and dangerous place dominated by the will of the cosmic gods. It is best to explore Irid Novo with the help of a friend.\nHellpoint supports splitscreen co-op and player versus player on all platforms. You can play the whole game with a friend, or have him jump up in and out anytime he likes. The loot is shared, and the experience of player two is saved and not watered down. In our youth, we've had countless nights of couch gaming fun, playing with friends and siblings until the sun rose. With Hellpoint, we want to bring back couch gaming into a genre that we think cruelly lacks it.\nFor centuries, the galaxy has been at peace. With the discovery of interstellar travel and the access to infinite resources that ensued, brutal wars are now a thing of the past. To survive the wrath of cosmic gods and hordes of monsters, you will have to find ancient blueprints and craft long forgotten weapons and armors and acquire forbidden powers. You play the way you want, will it be a sword and a shield, or a firearm and your mastery over the cosmic energies?\nHellpoint allows you to play the way you want. Using our crafting and customization system, you can adjust your weapons and powers according to your own play style. Do you prefer your healing power to heal more over time or instantaneously? Go edit your power in one of the crafting station, and make it work the way you like. Would you prefer your energy missiles to explode on impact, or to ricochet off enemies? The choice is yours to modify them as you see fit.\nThe more you fight with a weapon, the more proficient you become with it and eventually you unlock powerful abilities. This can go from an extra long range combo attack to a shattering explosion that sends enemies flying.\nA terrible quantum cataclysm happened on board Irid Novo and is spreading to the whole multiverse. Piercing the very fabric of space to reach parallel universes is not something mortals should be allowed to play with. However, those breaches into other universes could very well be the key for you to make things right...\nEvery time you start a new game, the station is different. Rooms, enemies, puzzles, events, all are parts of the multiverse. This means that while our level design is carefully hand crafted, no two games are exactly the same. The game stay fresh as you never know what to except around the corner. As you die, you are pulled away from your universe of origin, and you wake up into the next. The more you die, the more the world changes around you.",

The first one is a classical story mode.\nYou play as a taxi driver, who is doing his work when the virus appears. You need to get to the military checkpoint, where you have to complete different missions: picking up survivors around the city, transporting something or even killing. You have to fight with the bosses – substantial mutated zombies. In the second mode, Blood Race, the player enters the brutal race. You can chase the cars and take them down. There are three distinct game types: classic race; eliminator, where the player needs to take down cars as many as he can; the endurance, in which you need to race with a ticking bomb in your vehicle. The last one is Slaughter. You try to survive on different arenas as long as you can. \n\n###Gameplay \nAs for the vehicles, there are 13 types of driving. It includes a fire truck, bulldozer, and tank.\nEvery vehicle feels different, so you can taste it and choose the most convenient one. Upgrading the vehicle on the fly is possible. The game offers the variety of weapons. You can burn zombies with flamethrowers or attack with the launcher. You fight with crowds of zombies at a time, especially in the Slaughter mode.

If our game leaves any scars, we hope you won’t be able to see them.\r\n\r\nYou play the game as Paul Prospero, an occult-minded detective who receives a disturbing letter from Ethan Carter. Realizing the boy is in grave danger, Paul arrives at Ethan’s home of Red Creek Valley, where things turn out to be even worse than he imagined. Ethan has vanished in the wake of a brutal murder, which Paul quickly discerns might not be the only local murder worth looking into.\r\n\r\nInspired by the weird fiction (and other tales of the macabre) from the early twentieth century, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter aims to significantly evolve immersive storytelling in games. While it features a private detective and quite a few mental challenges, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is not an especially puzzle-ridden game. Our focus is on atmosphere, mood, and the essential humanity of our characters.\r\n\r\nStill, the discoveries won’t happen on their own, or without your help. Using both Paul’s supernatural skill of being able to communicate with the dead, and your own powers of observation, you will discover the mystery behind a trail of corpses, the roots of a dark ancient force lurking in Red Creek Valley, and the fate of a missing boy.",

Despite the simplicity of the concept and of the controls, the game is very competitive, and many media called the game one of the best multiplayer experience of 2014. The name is consonant with serpent from the Norse mythology Níðhöggr, the snake appears in the game, eating the winner of the duel. The game draws inspiration from the game, which was released in 1984 - Great Swordsman, and for development used software GameMaker: Studio, which is available on Steam. Who wouldn’t want to create a game where you impale a friend, eh? \n\n###Key features\nPlayers get control over two game models that differ only in color. Controls are standard: jump, move, slide and throw the sword at your opponent. You can attack at three different heights: high, medium and low. Hit the opponent's sword to disarm the latter, and he will have to raise the sword again. The main task is to reach the end of the enemy territory. The first player who accomplished this wins. There are four different levels available for solo, local and online multiplayer. Later, the developers added new modes, like a tournament and the ability to use weapons differently.",

For example, long vehicles, such as cargo trucks, will not be able to ride on steep constructions, so the bridge has to adjust itself based on the weight of the vehicle. \n\nThere are also several obstacles for the player-built bridges present in the game, as sometimes a boat can spawn on the level and try to swim under the bridge. Storms are also a vital part of the gameplay, as the players have to also take into the amount the power of wind and adjust their creation as well.\n\nThe main catch of the game is that the players do not have unlimited resources, so they will have to make the best out the things at hand.

It is a remaster of Worms 2: Armageddon.\n\nThe gameplay is not much different from the other installments in the series. The game revolves around two opposite teams of worms that use everything in their power to eliminate each other.\n\nAt the beginning of the round, the worms spawn across the map. Each worm has a specific amount of health points. If a worm is attacked by an enemy, injures itself or falls down from high altitude, the health points are taken away. Health can be regenerated using medkits which are dropped down from the sky every several turns. Weapons and bonuses can also be picked up. \n\nThe game is turn-based. During a turn, the player can move around the map, attack the enemy and so on. Each turn has a time limit. The player wins when the opposing team is killed and at least one friendly worm survives.\n\nThe game features several game modes each with their own rules and differences. The players have the ability to create custom games. It is possible to make a completely new set of rules, pick a new map and other parameters in a custom game mode.",

Speaking of surroundings, nonetheless, it is safe to say, that the Horizon 3's scene is an Australia. The previous chapters of racing have pushed a narrative about the players being a participator of Horizon Festival. Now the protagonist becomes a host of the event, so they must play organizing roles, too. For example, hire drivers and adjust the racing grounds.\r\nThere are some events players can be a part of.  For example, drifting competition, Bucket List challenges and time trials. All of them utilize the same mechanics of getting to the finish line as fast as possible.

Game events begin in 1066, but there are often no time limits, so theoretically, missions can last dozens and even hundreds of game years.\n\n###The path of war and the path of peace\n\nThe game allows you to build - a settlement or a castle, carry out individual economic missions or just build freely, and destroy - invade the country, take the castle under siege or, on the contrary, crush the attackers. You can create your own maps and play in multiplay mode.\n\n###Gameplay\n\nYou are the ruler of the castle, you are responsible for both the economy and the war. Do not forget about the popularity - it's a separate indicator in the game.\n\nYou can build six types of buildings:\nthe castle and everything inside it - walls, towers, gates, barracks, ditches, etc.,\nsawmills, quarries, mines and other structures for extraction of resources - wood, stone, iron and oil.\nFarms that bring meat, milk, wheat, apples, hops, skins of cows,\ncity ​​buildings - houses, churches, wells,\nWeapon workshops, where they produce weapons and armor,\nBarns and shops for cheese, bread, ale\n\nBuildings are built instantly, it is only necessary to make such a decision. Just as quickly your soldiers are trained. But all this requires money obtained from the collection of taxes and trade.\n\nTo succeed in the economy it is not enough just to make calculations. We have to cope with unpredictable disasters like the invasion of rabbits or fire.\n\nThe war is fought by soldiers of close combat and distant combat: archers, crossbowmen, pikemen, swordsmen, spearmen, knights and even monks with clubs.\n\nTroops can shoot from towers, move around walls, destroy walls, use siege machines, including towers, while besieged have boiling resin tanks, pits with stakes and moats with water. You can dig trenches and even organize an epidemic in the enemy camp. For complex actions, except soldiers, you need to involve sappers and engineers.\n\n###Addition Stronghold Crusader HD\n\nExpands the set of game situations with the stories of the Crusades:\nThe first crusade of 1094-1099,\nSaladin's campaigns of 1187,\nthe expedition of Richard the Lionheart, Friedrich Barbarossa and the French Philip II in order to liberate Jerusalem\n\nThe way of the crusader is a campaign of 50 cards not tied to historical events, but in the same setting.\n\nOne of the unique innovations are the assassins - the warriors of special abilities, able to invisibly enter the castle and open the gate from the inside, interrupting the guard.",

The pirates noticed that they have heard this story a thousand times already and asked Guybrush to tell something new. The hero shares that the events of the new chapter of his adventures are unfolding right now: he is looking for the legendary pirate treasure of Big Whoop.\n\n###Key features\nThe game is a classic point-and-click adventure.

The game ignores almost all expansions to the original title, except for Battle Out of Hell.

In the beginning Death makes a deal with the protagonist, Daniel Garner that she will return his dead wife in exchange for 7,000 souls. From this moment the action begins, as you get a huge magic gun and start killing hordes of monsters.\n\nIn the core of the gameplay lays classic shooter mechanics; you can use multiple weapons, including brand new ones to defeat demons. The game consists of several chapters and original levels, each set in a unique landscape. Besides the campaign that can be completed alone or in a two-players co-op, there are several PvP modes, for example, survival and deathmatch for up to eight players.",

From the genre of the shooter from the third person the game took a powerful action in the entourage of several visual styles - comics of the 50's, neon lights of the 80's and 90's, cold dynamics of the 00's. Much in the design of locations is a quote or allusions to famous works of science fiction of the fifties.\n\n###Instead of the invasion of the Reds, an invasion from the Red Planet\nMars invades the US with its iconic 50s-styled flying saucers, insectoid drones, various robots in the size of a skyscraper, rolling balls that turn into death machines on stilts, floating bombs, iconic 50's-styled flying saucers. The aliens are rolling in waves, from different directions.\n\n###Sci-Fi archetypes\nCharacters that can be played correspond to the chosen style of pulp-sci-fi, including a jetpack piloting heroine, a shotgun wielding space cowboy, a secret government agent, and a battle hardened Marine captain.\n\nYou can play on behalf of one of the characters, but you can also unite with others, and this will give the most guaranteed victory.\n\n###Gameplay\nYou can fight in different ways - attack the aliens, personally shooting them, or building a network of defensive structures. When building, you can use money, sell unnecessary.\n\nYou can alternate the way of action - to run and shoot, and then to build something and so on. Of course, in this situation, there is no time for deep strategic calculations, so the strategic part of the game is not as elaborate as in the games of the strategic genre itself.\n\nThe canon of the genre tower defense is presented in the game much more fully - there are quite useful tools, a great variety of units. For defense with weapons, the player has the soldiers with rocket-propelled grenades, gun turrets, weapons that freeze and fire the enemies and so forth.",

The Multiwinians are two-dimensional creatures, hence the subtitle Survival of the Flattest. The world around them, however, is surprisingly three-dimensional, albeit with very minimalistic, intentionally low-polygonal graphics that are meant to represent a virtual simulation. Hence, Multiwinia is all about gameplay, not the plot or visuals.\nYou control a tribe of Multiwinians, who look as small, static, vaguely human-like silhouettes. Each tribe is distinct from another in color only. There are six modes, each with its own conditions of victory; those are Assault, Blitzkrieg, Capture the Statue, Domination, King of the Hill, and Rocket Riot. Some of this modes require Multiwinians to capture certain points on the map or to destroy a specific enemy unit, such as a weapon of mass destruction. Each mode allows both a single-player game against the CPU and a multiplayer for up to four players. The controls in Multiwinia are innovative and somewhat unusual yet intuitive.

The main campaign focuses on a fictional conflict in the Middle East, featuring both single-player mode and cooperative multiplayer.  The battles in Operation Flashpoint are unique in a way that the players will feel the battleground, facing a real threat of getting their platoon killed, therefore making them plan their every step and use the surroundings to ensure victory.\nWhile, the game lacks competitive multiplayer, due to its focus on realism and refined experience of a fast-paced military simulator, the cooperative experience will allow players to fully immerse themselves in what would seem like a real test of nerves, teamwork, and tactics.",

Back on Earth, the overpopulation forced the humanity to launch several expeditions to colonize the alien worlds. The game is set on Maximus after it was attacked by the insectoid alien invaders. The levels represent various Earth biospheres contained within the ship.\nJudging by its main gameplay features, Space Hack is, basically, Diablo in space. It’s a straightforward hack-and-slash game that uses the same point-and-click controls and even a level design similar to Diablo. There’s a safe base where you heal your wounds and purchase equipment, and from there you lead Hack through the monster-infested Maximus. Compared to Diablo, the game puts an even stronger emphasis on the combat and has fewer RPG elements. The game has no character selection and no classes. There’s a skill system, but it is your equipment that has the most influence on gameplay. Hack uses a variety of sci-fi firearms that freeze, burn, or explode the alien bugs, as well as melee weapons, armor, and special items. His health regenerates over time, but the process is slow, so the protagonist will require Medpacks to restore HP.",

The game puts a heavy focus on cooperative playthrough in its  Survival mode. It doesn’t differ much from the single-player mode, as you need to protect the base from a certain amount of enemy waves. But here you work together with other players and need to unite your actions to be more efficient. Another new mode is Sabotage. Here you compete with the second team, killing enemies. The team that survives the most waves wins; you can prevent your opponents from the victory, summoning monsters and ruining their traps.",

The player follows the adventures of Gabriel Belmont through medieval settings and modern environments. Sometimes — at the start of the story, to be precise — the players gain control of Dracula who possesses Gabriel and gives him similar powers. The game consists of many fighting sequences in which combos are of importance — the various swords and claws, some allowing the protagonist to replenish his health and the other dealing massive damage to the enemies.\n\n###Story\nThe game is highly story-driven. At the start, the developers present the players with the scenes of flashbacks, in which the transformation to Dracula is shown. While set in medieval settings, events depict Dracula as he quickly gets ambushed by his resurrected son and thrown back into the modern times where he starts his adventures.\n\n###DLC\nThe Revelations DLC released a month after the initial game announcement brings some story arc to the game, while the others: \"Dark Dracula\" and \"Armored Dracula\" bring only new characters skins and sprites.",

On the other hand, you fight aliens during turn-based battles. As the game is set underwater, your weaponry is limited and you have to study new technologies to produce and improve it. Unlike in the previous title, in Terror From the Deep you can use melee combat along with guns and special devices.\n\nThe game features various missions with different goals. Some of them include fights on several locations, the others are terror missions on huge map layouts.",

It can be described as the mix of modern Europe and futuristic setting with high fantasy influences. The game follows six main heroes, five of which are members of the elite military organization called SeeD, on their quest to defeat Ultimecia, an evil sorceress who wishes to compress time. Like its predecessor, Final Fantasy VII, the game heavily focuses on its story, characters and game world exposure.  \n\n###Gameplay \nThe gameplay of Final Fantasy VIII shares many similarities with other JRPGs of that era. The player can explore the overworld, visit different locations such as town, settlements, forests, interact with NPCs and fight numerous types of monsters in turn-based battles.\nWhile the world exploration aspect, for the most part, is similar to that of the previous game, the battle system has several notable differences. The combat in the game is centered on Junction system that allows the player to junction summoned monsters known as Guardian Forces to platy members. That gives characters the ability to use various magic, alter their stats and draw spells from enemies during the battles. Because of the system’s flexibility regarding character customization, the game is absent of job system typical for the series.",

This world has different geography and history, albeit its countries and cultures are based on prototypes from our real world. Skies Unknown follows the Lighthouse War (also called the Second Continental War) a conflict between the Kingdom of Erusea and the Osean Federation in an alternate 2019. The goal of the war is to control the International Space Elevator. The Erusean army attacks the Osean military that protected the Elevator. In response, Osea launches a large-scale attack against Farbanti, Erusea's capital city, causing massive loss of civilian lives.\n\n###Main characters\nThe main protagonist in the Skies Unknown story campaign is Trigger, a pilot in the Osean Air Force. He was framed for murder and transferred to the penal squadron. While the player starts as an Osean military, the game does not favor any side in the conflict. Rosa Cossette D'Elise, a princess and heir to the throne of Erusea, also plays a major role in the plot.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player controls Trigger's fighter plane, F-22A Raptor, and completes various missions against enemy fighter jets. Other types of aircraft do not appear in this game, unlike in the previous games. The game reintroduces some of the mechanics from the previous installments, such as checkpoints and player-controlled flares.

Our approach with the project was to make the kind of game we used to play, something that had both casual appeal and a limitless competitive ceiling. It was also a genre that we felt hasn't been adequately adapted to the modern world of game design. Our vision was simple: build a game that's easy to pick up, hard to master, and fun both on and off screen....AND A BIT ABOUT POLYBALLThere's a lot to do in Polyball -- Challenge yourself or a friend to one of over 60 levels included in the initial release, with plans for many more levels via free DLC. If you've got some friends over and are looking for something to play, Polyball's splitscreen multiplayer promises a good time. With classic modes like Battle and Circuit Race, as well as a multiplayer version of the single-player experience, Polyball promises to be a must-have party game.CASUAL, COMPETITIVE, OR BOTHWith global leaderboards built right into the level select menu and pregame screen, you can see where you stand among the worlds best and race against their ghosts. If you're more interested in beating your friends, check out the friends-only leaderboards. Collecting shards during your single-player journey will unlock a vast array of customization options, from different ball models to particle effects. This customization carries over into online multiplayer matches as well as your high-score ghost, with local multiplayer having its own version of the customization system designed for split-screen play.FOR THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLEIf you've mastered every challenge we put into the game, take a look at the Steam Workshop content to face a whole new set of challenges. Community made content, from multiplayer battle maps and circuit tracks to customization options and single-player levels, will bridge the gap between developer and player as well as provide a steady stream of new content for you to experience. Steam Workshop gives the players a voice, allowing for the mechanics and level designs of Polyball to stretch far beyond what we had initially put into the game.FEATURES\n60+ levels and free DLC\nPowerful customization system\nFull controller support\nExtensive multiplayer support - online/splitscreen\nGlobal/Friends Leaderboards\nFull soundtrack made by independent artists\nSteam Workshop\nTuned mechanics and balanced levels based on community feedback\nMac/Windows/Linux support\nAlternate language localization\nGhosts\nSteam Cloud SavesMULTIPLAYER MODES\nTrails\nBattle\nCircuit Race\nTower Climb\nSplit-Screen + Online Story Mode\nMany more!\nPlease be sure to check the Early Access tab to see the current state of the game.",

The game's core feature is the variety of moral decision — the player decides who is worthy of sacrificing for the sake of the group's survival.\nThe gameplay features walking and talking with the other characters — six in total — while a heavy accent is made on time- and resource management. The game's name derives from the absence of right and wrong decisions: not only the survival of the team is a task at hand but the survival of an outside world from genocide.",

The players control Dante, a veteran of crusades, looks for his beloved Beatrice who got taken by Lucifer. As Dante descends deeper into Hell, he has to face more and more horrific creatures, his own sins and the dark history of his family.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe gameplay of Dante's Inferno is similar to most slayer games. The core mechanics of the genre are to control a character who traverses different locations and eliminates every enemy they find on their path (demons in this case). The protagonist's weapons are long-ranged, allowing for the mass murder of their enemies. \n\nThe boss battles in the game are heavily inspired by God of War, where the player firstly fights with the boss and later uses a quick-time event to finish their enemy off. \n\nMultiple platforming puzzles are present in the game. The levels itself consist of multiple interconnected platforms. There are numerous spots where the players have to jump to, not without using their weapons on several occasions. \n\nTwo weapons are present in the game: the Death's Scythe and a Holy Cross, which differ both in their usage and their role in the game's character progression system. Both weapons have their own upgrade trees which require souls. Souls can be acquired by killing enemies with one of the weapons.",

By 2034, our planet is devastated and mostly covered with ice. The last remnants of humanity are trying to defeat the invading alien machines, who stay besieged in their highly fortified bases.\n\n###Gameplay\nLike its predecessors, Anomaly 2 puts the player in control of a convoy of armored vehicles. The goal of each mission is to fight your way through the enemy territory that is protected with defense towers and units. The game has no construction options or resource mining, but there are repair zones on each level. They allow the player to upgrade, purchase, or sell his or her units right in the middle of a mission. Anomaly 2 introduces a new gameplay option: morphing. All vehicles have more than one shape and can morph into different units with unique abilities.\n\n###Multiplayer\nAnomaly 2 is the first game in the series to introduce multiplayer. This mode allows playing as either humans or alien machines. Humans gameplay is the same as in single mode. Playing for the alien side, however, completely changes the game and turns it into the tower defense where the player's goal is to withstand the siege.",

It is the first part of the original Gears of War trilogy.\n\n###Plot\nGears of War takes place on a planet called Sera, that is much like Earth. The radioactive fluid that was later named Imulsion became a potent energy source after the scientists found a way to use it. This substance caused mutations to the wildlife that lived in caves. 14 years later, after several wars, the Coalition of Ordered Governments is the only human government on the planet. \n\nYou play as Marcus, who gets back in the army after four-year imprisonment for disobeying his commanding officer to save his own father.\n\n###Gameplay\nGears Of War revolves around third-person combat and the usage of cover by the player. When the player is hit, the Crimson Omen is displayed on the screen. A crimson red sign that is used as the player's health indicator. To regenerate health, the players have to hide behind cover.\n\nThe game's story is divided into 5 acts that can be played both in singleplayer or in co-op mode. A multiplayer mode is also present in the game.\n\n###Multiplayer\nPlayers battle each other in 5v5 matches. All matches can be played in Ranked mode, where one's progress is tracked or create custom lobbies for your friends.\n\n###Ultimate Edition features\nUltimate Edition is a remastered version of the game, which includes new cutscenes, refined graphics, all DLCs and tweaked multiplayer.",

    "description": "ArcaniA is set in the world of Gothic game series and was originally announced as Gothic 4. It was eventually released as a standalone spin-off game with only minor connections to the main plot of Gothic.\n\n###Plot\nRhobar III, the king of Myrtana and the former protagonist of the Gothic trilogy, sent his army to conquer the Southern Islands. It seems that the king is possessed by an evil force. The protagonist is a young man from the island of Feshyr. As he prepares to marry, Rhobar's army invades the island, killing the protagonist's family. Now he's to become the new Nameless Hero like Rhobar once was. His goal is to avenge his family and to save the world from the madness of the king. \n\n###Setting\nThe game is set in a high fantasy universe. The world is open, however, it is divided into several regions, each of them serving as an open world in itself. To unlock a new region, the protagonist has to complete certain quests for NPCs that unlock new regions. \n\n###Gameplay\nDespite not being the proper part of Gothic series, the game shows a strong similarity to the original trilogy. It is a 3D third-person RPG with a strong emphasis on action. Some of the game's mechanics became simpler. The creators scrapped most spells from the previous games, leaving only three (fire, ice, and lightning), although they can be upgraded. There are three character classes: Warrior, Mage, or Ranger. The protagonist levels up automatically, but to distribute his XP to certain skill is up to the player. Unlike the rest of Gothic games, ArcaniA doesn't use sleep to skip time and restore health.",

The main difference is that the Regular Builders are unable to build objects without the needed instructional pages, while the Master Builders can build any object at any time. All the objects built by the players resemble the items from the real-life Lego sets. \n\n90 characters are present in the game.

    "description": "Xenonauts is a strategy game in which you control a multi-national military organisation defending a Cold War-era Earth from alien invasion, using small squads of persistent soldiers to eliminate the extraterrestrials and recover their technology in turn-based ground combat. A detailed strategic layer allows you to co-ordinate the defence of the planet, using your interceptors to shoot down UFOs and researching captured artefacts to learn about your foes and unlock new combat equipment to use on your missions.\nXenonauts is a spiritual successor to the classic X-Com strategy games from the 1990s. We aim to improve the graphics, add new content and streamline the interface whilst still retaining all of the key mechanics of the original games. Devoted fans should love this game, but we're also keen to introduce the joys of old-school grand strategy to a whole new generation of players who might not otherwise experience it!\nPlease note that the native Mac / Linux versions of the game are still in beta, however older WINE-wrapped \"ports\" are available and known to be stable whilst development of the native ports is still ongoing.Key Features\nGround Combat: Xenonauts delivers tense turn-based combat across realistic, varied and fully-destructible battlefields, against almost fifty different variants of enemy. Missions range from capturing crashed UFOs or alien bases to defending cities (or even Xenonaut facilities) against alien attack. You'll experience the chill of encountering a new alien for the first time and the joys of test-firing a new weapon for the first time. Deeply asymmetric combat keeps the battles interesting - after all, you're fighting intergalactic invaders with 1970's ballistic technology! Strategic Management: You will also be managing the defence of the planet, dealing with the invading alien UFOs with your customisable interceptors. You need to balance the needs of your funding nations with your own. Your funds are limited - are you going to spend them on battlefield equipment, more scientists, or expanding your coverage of the planet? Your priorities must be balanced carefully if you are to win the war. Research Tree: Xenonauts has an extensive research tree with almost a hundred projects to unlock, each with its own unique description and painted artwork. It slowly reveals the intentions and origins of the invaders, while also unlocking new battlefield equipment, aircraft and vehicles for you to use as you harness alien technology and turn it against them.  Persistent Soldiers: Soldiers in Xenonauts are persistent from mission to mission, improving their stats and gaining ranks with combat experience - but their deaths are always only a single bad move away. You will grow to care about the brave men and women under your command as they slowly grow from green rookies into hardened veterans, but that only makes it more painful when their heroic tale is cruelly cut short by a burst of plasma fire... Detailed, Emergent Simulation: Xenonauts contains no scripted missions, just broad rules setting the pace of the invasion. As such, no game plays out the same twice. If you shoot a Scout UFO down over a polar area, you get a Crash Site mission where you can capture a crashed Scout UFO in an Arctic tileset. Commence a battle at night and you'll be fighting the mission in the darkness with reduced sight range. If your base is attacked, you fight the defence in a perfect replica of your base. A lot of time has gone into weaving the two very different halves of the game together into something that feels both natural and enjoyable.",

The also used to be available on Wii Shop Channel for 1000 Wii Points (about $10). \n\n###Gameplay \nThe game revolves around 1vs1 duels between doll-like minimalistic characters against either CPU or other players via the internet. Toribash is notable for its unique mix of fighting game and turn-based strategy based on ragdoll physics.\nInstead of commanding character to perform certain attacks or special moves, the players manipulate various joints on the character’s model. It includes relaxing, holding, contracting and extending different parts of the doll’s body. After pressing spacebar, the model starts moving according to the player’s command for several frames and then the next turn begins. The goal of each match is either to gain more points than your opponent or to knock them outside the ring. Players earn points by successfully performing different punches, kicks, grabs and other moves. \nToribash multiplayer offers many different game modes. They vary depending on how many frames one turn takes, the distance between characters or specific aspects of in-game physics. There are also many player-made modifications to the game that change the dolls’ type, the way they move or add additional objects to the environment.",

Run the sheriff’s department, manage your cops, investigate, interrogate, and incarcerate. Make tough decisions – and try to keep out of prison yourself! – in this story-driven mixture of adventure, strategy, and turn-based tactical combat.\nIs it a simulation? A management game? A tactical challenge? A visual novel? A puzzle? It’s all of these, and more!Dive into one-of-a-kind -story driven experience.Welcome to Sharpwood, a cold and harsh border town riven with violence, where no one is completely innocent. Smugglers, gangs, and screaming populists call this town their home. To maintain peace and order, the young sheriff Lilly Reed (Sarah Hamilton, The Longest Journey) will have to team up with fugitive criminal Jack Boyd (Jon St. John, Duke Nukem), and pray that her dangerous plan doesn’t spiral out of control.\nTake charge of the Sheriff’s department.Your subordinates aren’t just some resource; they are living people with their own strengths, weaknesses, fears and prejudices – and you'll have to reckon with all of them in order to survive. Is one of your guys drinking too much alcohol? Or always coming up with excuses for not coming to work? Or does he refuse to follow orders? You’ll have to show a steady hand if you want to impose discipline on this department.\nEngage in tactical combat.During your most dangerous operations, the game will switch to turn-based combat. Gather a team of your finest cops (or use your drunk and stupid bums – you don’t always have the luxury of being choosy!). Carefully study the terrain, adapt your plans, stealthily approach your suspects and use non-lethal weapons and equipment – if the situation allows. True, sometimes gunfights are almost impossible to avoid, but be careful: This Is the Police 2 doesn’t have hit points. A single bullet can cost a cop their life.\nBecome a true detective.Collect evidence, study case materials, interrogate suspects (or use more... forceful methods) and send the criminals to court. And if the suspect was innocent? Perhaps it's time to find out if any Sharpwood judges can be bought.",

The player takes control of Princess Amelie, as in the previous game, and guides her through two independent story campaigns.

It was developed by ACE Team.\n\nThe game is loosely based on the myth of Sisyphus. The main objective of the player is to use a giant boulder in order to destroy the enemy castle located at the bottom of the hill while at the same time defending your own stronghold using various structures. Players can build money farms to raise the funds necessary to build defensive structures or upgrade the boulder itself. After gathering a certain amount of money it is possible to equip both defensive and offensive upgrades to the boulder. The enemies can destroy the boulder in which case the player has to wait until the boulder spawns again and proceed with the offense. The player wins if they successfully destroy the enemy's castle gates and place the boulder right in the center of the castle. \n\nThere are five distinctive time periods present in the game, such as romanticism, rococo, renaissance, and so on.",

The game follows a player made character that joins Fenrir, an organization that aims to exterminate Aragami using God Arcs, the weapon made from Aragami’s cells.  \n\n###Gameplay \nThe game consists of more than 100 missions that can be played both cooperatively or competitively. The goal of each mission is to slay specific enemies with the time limit.\nThe God Arc is the only weapon available to the player. However, it can transform into three different forms: blade, gun, and shield. The character has various moves such as dashing, jumping, sprinting as well as several types of attack. These moves and using God Arc in blade form consumes player’s stamina. Using gun mode, on the other hand, consumes Oracle Points that can be replenished by attacking enemies in blade mode. \n\n###Resurrection version \nThe remaster of the game named God Eater Resurrection was released 2016 for PS4, PS Vita and Windows.

Overcast tells a story of an old hunter, living in complete solitude in the forest near the remote village. But players will have to deal with the fact, that now there’s a dangerous creature, that’s been haunting every human around, killing every resident of the village and now it’s the hunter’s turn.\nThe game offers similar mechanics to the source of main inspiration – Amnesia. Players will have to carry a lantern and hunt down several monsters in each of a few in-game chapters. Unlike Amnesia, Overcast has gunplay, map system, and scarce checkpoints, adding the high risk of replaying the chapter from the beginning, if players lost focus and made a mistake of dying too close, to the end of the chapter. The original game soundtrack is using guitar compositions to set the tone and ease the tension after the horror scenes or jump-scares. There are three distinct monster types, and each of them introduced from a first-person perspective of the said monster, adding to the tension. The game gained a surge of popularity, due to the game being played and recommended by several big YouTubers.",

In general, every class has their unique abilities that can be upgraded with the in-game currency and real money. Wisely balanced teams have more chances to win battles.\n\nThe key feature that differs Happy Wars from other MOBA-type games is that before you destroy your opponent’s base you need to build yours. Bases are equipped with multiple weapons so it’s hard to get close to the enemy rift. Besides the center, there are several control points; the most massive battles are usually held near them.

You can only claim railroad parts if you have enough railway car cards that match the road’s color. The amount of train pieces you spend depends on the length of the railroad fragment. \nClaiming routes and connecting cities on your Destination Ticket card give you points at the end of the game.

ODST do not have Spartans' abilities and equipment, they are weaker, slower and lack the deflector shields to protect them.

Hope is but a faded memory for all but one: a priestess named Kaho from the village of Lun. If only Kaho could somehow gain audience with the Queen, Her Majesty could surely be convinced to lend her power to help save the land and its inhabitants from certain doom―but time is short, and each coming night falls darker than the last...\nReverie Under The Moonlight is the fourth installment in the Momodora series of side-scrolling action platformers, featuring melee combos, dodge mechanics, and a plethora of items and spells to unleash upon your enemies. Play casually to fully take in and enjoy the rich setting and engaging, mysterious story, or crank up the difficulty to run your reflexes through a truly brutal gauntlet.\nBeautifully animated graphics\nExciting action gameplay: pull off impressive combos, dodge attacks, and skewer enemies with arrows\nIntense boss battles with challenging patterns and epic scale\nDifficulty settings appropriate for all types of players―from story and setting lovers to hardcore action enthusiasts\nA breadth of items that can be combined to facilitate new strategies\nAn amazingly diverse world to explore, filled with secrets and treasures\nEccentric allies and foes with compelling personalities\nMysterious lore and rich backstory woven into events, dialogue, and item descriptions\nFor this fourth installment in the Momodora series―which actually serves a prequel to the previous games―the primary focus during development was on improvements to the gameplay and art. The combat gameplay has truly evolved since the days of Momo III, and the character sprites are now bigger and better animated.\nWe also made an effort to include more tiny details here and there, expand on the world lore, and create more exciting boss battles.\nI believe this is the best Momodora game in the series, and definitely the most polished title so far.\nMost of us at Playism grew up playing video games during the early days of the NES, and throughout the years, action-platformers have been some of the staples in our respective game libraries. Long before “Metroidvania” was a thing, we fell in love with the original Castlevania series, as well as with other Hall of Famers such as the Metroid, Contra, and Ninja Gaiden games. About halfway through the lifecycle of the first-generation PlayStation, sprite-based game development took an unfortunate nosedive, and the sorts of games we loved most and grew up with just weren't being made as frequently or, frankly, with as much love and care as they once were.\nIndie game development really helped to reinvigorate both the sprite-based action-platformer genre and the magic of actual sprite animation. rdein's games combine what we’ve always loved about tight-action 2D gaming with splendid influences from more modern games like Dark Souls. The dedication to your actions necessitated by animation locks; the insane intensity driving the boss fights and how epic it is that this quaint little heroine can tackle these heroic endeavors; the attention to detail in the environments, designs, and animations... all of this stuff is simply stunning and rdein pulls it off to beautiful effect.\nThen there’s also the story itself, which is also a masterpiece in game storytelling: a strange, mysterious world that you inhabit with countless hopeless souls whom you are trying to save. There is painstaking detail in every item, every snippet of dialogue. You find yourself constantly readjusting how you feel about these people. You're trying to save them, but do they even want to be saved? Or should you be more worried about that awkwardly sinister tone in their voices...?\nMomodora: RUTM shouldn’t exactly be categorized as “Metroidvania” or “Souls-like”, but there certainly are elements of both contained within. It's a game of its own, and it’s one of the best entries in the mind-bogglingly expansive genre of side-scrolling action-platformers. We at Playism all love the game, and we can state with absolute confidence that if you’ve bothered to read this far, then you certainly will, too.",

The story follows a Mexican runaway that does not remember anything about his past other than there is a bounty on his head. The game is notable for its art style that imitates pictures drawn with pen and paper. The game’s visuals are stylized, but the story bluntly describes the brutal nature of the late 1800s.

The campaign consists of four acts that feature numerous missions centered on killing enemies as effectively as possible. One of the most notable characteristics of the gameplay is that you have to cock and reload your guns, using different buttons manually. The hero’s weaponry consists of iconic Wild West firearms such as revolvers, double-barreled shotguns, rifles, and bows. Between missions, you come across hub towns in which you can restock ammo, buy upgrades or take side-quests to earn more money. \r\nBesides the primary campaign, there is an arena mode that makes you fight waves of enemies.",

Therefore, efforts on a single campaign were apparently less elaborated than on multiplayer, so the singleplayer in the game is secondary.\n\nVisually the game is a heap of swirling nebulae, among which there are several strips of a battlefield. Is necessary to arrange the towers at special points along with the battlefield. The towers look like clots of energy, which, as the enemy approaches, begin to attack.\n\nDuring the completion of the game, players have separate resources, and they can build at any point of the map. So there is a little need for cooperation. The appearance of additional players on the map almost does not affect the gameplay in any way. Although the existing arsenal in the game can appear huge, de facto players only have three main types of towers to deploy: ice, poison, and fire. The rest are their upgrades, which must be built separately for some reason.",

    "description": "This science-fiction game begins where most of the science fiction games end. Earthlings survived the invasion of hostile aliens - and were able to repel him. The battles were not even on the planet Earth itself, but at the space station. And at this station there were many traces of carnage. From blood to parts of aliens, from holes in the walls from bullets and shells to broken glass. And now all this must be cleaned, collected, and the garbage must be thrown away. A game about space janitors, and an extraordinary task for them.\n\n###Gameplay\nIn the course of the game, it is necessary to solve the tasks related to cleaning up of the huge space station, which survived the battle between the inhabitants of the Earth and the alien invaders, from the dirt and debris. It is necessary to remove the most diverse and exotic garbage: remains of bodies of aliens and earthlings, shot casings and broken glass, medicines for the wounded, weapons and who knows what else. It is necessary to wash the floors and walls of blood and soot, to seal holes from bullets in walls, ceilings and floors.\n\nAs tools, players have a mop to wash out stains, a special device for detecting biological remains, and a PDA. You can interact with garbage and simply with the help of hands.\n\nAt each level there are devices for cleaning and recycling garbage: an incineration plant, a source of clean water, a container in which smaller debris is placed, such as cans, liners and body parts, a welding device for repairing holes in walls, and a vending machine where the player can get lights, medicines, a \"wet floor\" sign, other signs and lamps. Sometimes these devices work incorrectly and produce even more pollution.\n\nThe player can figure out how to use improvised tools to speed up and simplify cleaning. On the other hand, the player should think about how his actions will affect the situation and will not lead to even more pollution and the need to clean the same place several times.\n\nAfter passing each level, the player enters the so-called \"The Office\". This is the place where the work done at this level is summed up. The player sees what he missed to draw conclusions for the future. In this place you can also get things as a reward for the work done.\n\nThe cleaning takes up any amount of time, but there are penalties for poorly executed work. If less than 75% of the territory is taken away, the player can be fired and he will lose all the accumulated achievements.\n\n###Additions.\nThere are several additions to the game. The gameplay in these additions is the same as in the main game, but setting is different.\n\nViscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior is set in the first chapter of the Flying Wild Hog's Shadow Warrior, cleaning up the mess.\n\nViscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage - the action takes place on the North Pole, and you have to clean up behind the crazy Santa Claus, in his workshop.\n\nA Halloween DLC pack entitled Viscera Cleanup Detail: House of Horror, featuring a crime scene of a house, where an unsolved mass murder has happened, while the player gets to uncover it during the gameplay.",

One of the most notable differences in the game comparing to the rest of the series is that most of the time you are accompanied by the squadmates that help you fight enemies. The player has 12 weapons to choose from, most of which are recurring from the previous games such as nailgun, shotgun, railgun, blaster.\nThe multiplayer includes six different game modes: Deathmatch, Tourney, Capture the Flag, Arena Capture the Flag and DeadZone.",

This multiplayer-oriented game unites players in teams of up to five to battle against each other on an arena, or to fight an AI-controlled team of the same size.\nThe game offers more than 30 playable characters, mostly from The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, including Bilbo, Sauron, Legolas, Gandalf, and Gollum. Their design is based on Peter Jackson's movie series. There are also several characters that don't appear directly in movies or books, such as Arathorn, father of Aragorn. All characters are divided into \"good\" and \"evil\" factions to preserve a semblance of continuity behind the battles, so that Kili wouldn't have to fight Thorin, for example. Treacherous Saruman can join either side.\nThe goal of each team is to destroy the enemy base that is protected not only by the opposing players but also by defense towers. Gameplay in Guardians of Middle-Earth has a distinct \"RTS\" feel to it. Both teams’ bases regularly spawn “minions” who join players in the fight, making the game more about clashes of armies than duels between individual champions. The RPG element is minimal, and there are no in-game items or upgrades.",

The scientist can't get out of a pocket dimension and the house you were staying in is now shattered across four dimensions with different properties. You have to get everything back together.\n\nThe player is able to run, jump and interact with several in-game objects. It is possible to die from hazardous liquids, bottomless pits, falling down from a great height or getting killed by lasers. The levels in the game are represented as the rooms of the house. The objective of each level is to find the exit door and get to it.\n\nThe players can manipulate the rooms traversing through the dimensions. Each dimension has its own physics. For example, in the Fluffy dimension, the objects are much lighter than normal. Players can access only one dimension at a time.",

The robots try to annihilate humans and send \"Harvesters\" to hunt for them. The protagonist is the last warrior who can stand up for the humankind.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player controls his or her character from the top-down view. Nex Machina contains six worlds divided by 15 levels. Each world ends with a boss fight. The player's primary objective is to defeat enemies, but there's also an optional objective to save humans scattered around levels.\n\n###Modes\nThere are two main modes. In the Single World, the worlds are consecutive, while in Arcade mode, the player can choose which world to play this time. The game has a local co-op and a competitive Online Arena mode, but no online cooperative multiplayer.\n\n###Combat system\nThe protagonist has several types of attacks. The regular gun can be upgraded by power-ups to increase its range and spread. There are also stronger additional weapons, such as a sword and an energy beam. The game aims to keep the action at a high tempo and puts an emphasis on the \"flow\" and timing. By using the character's attacks in the right progressions, the player can perform powerful combo movements.",

Therefore, the game uses a hybrid combo system that takes into account several important parameters: the character is chosen and how many moves have already been made. Also, the number of random enemy-encounters in one location is limited to a certain number.",

The world around consists of cubes; you have a physics-based ability to return them to their place before everything is destroyed.\n\nThe game is split into two modes. The Survival is classic: stay on the platform using your powers. The Dash mode adds to the concept a necessity to collect orbs on the same collapsing platform. All changes on the levels are random: there are no identical playthroughs. Every time you play Streamline, you face new challenges and ways to reach the goal.",

The player has to choose a company he or she will control. The other three companies become the player's rivals. They seldom fight outright, and their rivalry is largely economic. However, they can secretly organize acts of sabotage against each other, eliminate resources with underground nukes and hire goons to attack or defend. The main goal of the game is to assume control over all four companies by purchasing their majority stakes and to create a monopoly. If a rival company obtains the majority in the player's corporation, he or she loses the game.\n\n###Resources\nThe game puts a strong emphasis on mining and trading resources. Each level starts with the player scanning the surface of Mars to find resources and build his or her headquarters next to them. Offworld Trading Company has thirteen types of resources. Most of the resources, such as iron, aluminum, and water, can be mined from the Martian soil. Some, like steel, food, and chemicals, are produced from other resources and require special buildings. Each resource has a value that can increase or decrease depending on the demand and supply.",

    "description": "Cook, Serve, Delicious is a hardcore restaurant sim, one of the few in its genre that gives the players total control over where they want to take their restaurant.\n\nThe game centers on an old, worn down restaurant in the SherriSoda Tower, which was once the heart of the building but closed down as business (and tenants) dropped to an all time low. But with the local economy rising back up and occupancy reaching its maximum, SherriSoda Tower has decided to bring back the old Cook, Serve, Delicious restaurant, and has given you complete control to bring it back to its old five star status of world class dining.\n\nTo do that, you’ll start with a few thousand dollars and thirty foods to choose from to put on your menu, as well as a host of restaurant equipment and more. Nearly everything is unlocked from the start of the game for you to purchase; this is your restaurant, and you must figure out the best strategy to get that restaurant packed with satisfied customers. Can you prove your culinary skills?\n\nAnd if that weren’t enough, you’ll also have the opportunity to be cast in the Iron Cook television show, throw parties for offices in SherriSoda Tower, read virtual mail in your SherriSoda Tower Email account which ranges from game tips to crazy spam (nearly 500 emails in all), from customers providing feedback to your restaurant to opportunities such as being able to fund projects via “ClicknStart” and other big surprises!\n\nThe game draws a lot of inspiration from the original PlayStation game Ore no Ryouri. Cook, Serve, Delicious! was initially a free game that used hand-drawn graphics in its gameplay. The game's author David Galindo wanted to make a sequel for that game, but he had no funds to do so. After publishing his first attempt at releasing a full-scale game, Galindo earned some money that would be used for the development of Cook, Serve, Delicious!\n\nWith hours of content and tons of secrets and unlockables, Cook, Serve, Delicious will provide a big challenge for anyone who’s ready to take their crumbling, rat infested eatery to a luxurious Platinum Star Restaurant. Good luck!",

    "description": "This is an intense strategy board game in a steampunk world of corrupt capitalist gremlins who compete for money, political power and prestige. Save and invest, steal and extort, arrest and get arrested – in single-player and multiplayer, with ranks and ladders, team mode and spectator mode. Featuring seasonal content updates, regular tournaments, item drops, full support of Steam Community Market – and more!\n\nHOW DO YOU PLAY THIS GAME?\nGremlins, Inc. is designed for up to 6 players, in multiplayer or in single-player mode (with AI bots). Each player has 6 cards on their hand (replenished from the same deck) and uses them either to move around the playing field or to perform different game actions. There is a lot of interaction with other players, and duels are significantly different from 3-player or 4-player games. You can play until a certain score limit, or until agreed number of rounds, or for time limit. The game offers both custom and ranked sessions (with matchmaking by rating).\n\nCAN YOU PLAY IN TEAMS OR JUST WATCH?\nYes, you can! In addition to custom sessions (where you define the parameters of the session and may optionally set filters for those who can join you) and password-protected private sessions (so that you and your friends can play undisturbed), the game offers team mode (2x2, 3x3, or 2x2x2) with teams of human players and/or AI bots. Gremlins, Inc. also supports a built-in spectator mode, which allows you to watch sessions of other players right from inside of the game, sharing your emotions with players and other spectators through messages and emoticons.\n\nCAN YOU PLAY THIS GAME OFFLINE?\nCertainly! When you buy this game, you get 2 products in your Steam Library: Gremlins, Inc. – the edition that is playable online in single-player and multiplayer modes, with full support of item drops and Steam Workshop; and Gremlins vs Automatons – the edition that is playable offline in single-player mode, without any connection to our server whatsoever.\n\nHOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO PLAY ONE SESSION?\nThe game offers different session settings to make them fit your available time, and single-player mode offers automatic SAVE / LOAD function at every turn so that you can take a break whenever you want (while multiplayer mode offers re-connect functionality as long as the session is still in progress). A quick duel for 20 score points with a fast timer can finish in under 20 minutes, while a 4-player session for 60 rounds can last for 2 hours or more.\n\nSHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM STRATEGIES?\nThere are different types of cards in the game (permanent, regular, secret and criminal) and as each card can be used either to move or for action, you will develop both short-term and long-term strategies for making the most out of where you are, and what you currently have in your hand. Normally, you spend half of your game time accumulating resources and building the foundation for the end-game, and the other half trying to control the progress of your opponents (stealing, arresting, initiating player conflicts, and so on). The more you play, the more new strategies you will discover – especially when combining the effects of several cards played in a combination.\n\nMAKE DECISIONS, PLAN YOUR MOVES\nThis is an intense strategy game: make decisions at every round! Plan your moves, then adjust to the actions of the other players and new cards drawn.The design of the playing field and the multiple layers of optional features (that you can turn on or off, as you wish) allow for a variety of strategies. The more you play, the more roads to victory you discover, using a combination of features based on the particular setup of the session.The game offers a diverse resource system that allows for many comeback chances even after you're robbed or arrested (or both). With score, money, votes, malice, income and bribes, the tension often remains until the very last round.The multilayer mode of the game features a system of ratings, ladders and ranked sessions: compete in a specific league, and take part in the regularly organised tournaments with over 1,000 participants. A system of anonymous masks allows everyone to compete on equal terms in a ranked session.Additionally, the game offers over 10 single-player challenges plus the option to create custom single-player sessions with different settings and a different mix of AI bots.Finally, there's the team mode where victory is determined not only by strategic skill, but also by communication and coordination of each team, which is an entirely different layer of game mechanics.\n\nFACTS & FIGURES\n179 cards in the main deck (143 of them – unique): permanent, regular, secret and criminal, each with a hand-drawn steampunk illustration; with each Season update, we keep adding several new cards to the deck.38 events in the Misfortune deck: these are the special events triggered at certain moments in the game, and may affect the current standing of all players to a significant degree, especially when used on a specific opponent.6 special Chaos Cards: this is an optional set of cards available to every player in the game; turn them on or off to change the dynamics of the session.12 sets of Character Abilities: another optional feature that brings to the game special game mechanics unique to each character type; playing with these makes different competing strategies even more pronounced.11 original locations: the Office, the Plant, the Dump, the Marketplace, the Inferno, the Jail, the Casino, the Court, the Treasure, the Bank and the Astral Plane; and 7 original spot types: Risk, Gamble, Police, Income, Bribe, Misfortune and Tribune.Finally, the game took us three years to develop from concept to full release, and we're still committed to continue supporting the community through development of new content. There are currently over 120,000 players of Gremlins, Inc. on Steam from all over the world, including USA, Russia, China, Japan, UK and France. Collectively, players launched over one million game sessions in the three months since its release.\n\nFINALLY, WHO ARE THE GREMLINS?\nYou think that’s just a pocket watch in your hand, a watch that’s a bit late because you keep forgetting to wind it up? No, no and no – you couldn’t be further from the truth! What you carry around is a whole gremlin town packed into this tiny mechanism: a town with its own bank, its own casino… and even its own jail! Gremlins are the microscopic creatures that inhabit any mechanism that they can possibly infiltrate. If a watch or a telescope malfunctions, then it’s probably due to gremlins who took up a residence there.\n\nMore than anything in life, gremlins value money, political power and prestige: prestige that one can claim after completing some sort of a grandiose engineering project. Aside from working on their own projects, gremlins mostly spend their time preventing other gremlins from building something even more grandiose. This they achieve through bribing officials and lying to the electorate, as well through stealing from their competitors - and outright arresting them.\n\nA DISCLAIMER (JUST IN CASE)\nWe felt it important to note that Gremlins, Inc. is not a free-to-play game. Also, this is not a CCG or TCG: you do not need to buy boosters or packs; in every session the game offers the same deck to every player, and everyone's chances are equal.\n\nOUR DLC POLICY\nWe are committed to the principle of continuously updating the game with new features and new game content that come as regular updates, FREE to every owner of the product. At the same time, from time to time we release DLCs that feature fun cosmetic content. If you like it, you can support our efforts by your purchase. However, there is absolutely no pressure to own any of the DLCs in order to play the game or compete in the tournaments. Every player, whether they have DLCs or not, has access to the same game features and the same game mechanics.\n\nThe game also supports crafting: once you find a blueprint of a specific item, you can create as many such items as you wish, as long as you have the required number of charges (you get charges when you convert other in-game items that you do not want, or have multiple copies of). Finally, the game has its own Steam Item Store where we sell a very small number of unique items that influence the item meta-game (but they have no effect on the game mechanics).\n\nONLINE & OFFLINE VERSIONS\nGremlins, Inc. was designed as a digital board game with the multiplayer mode at its heart. However, this is not to say that we don't like single-player – we do, and there's a separate section with the single-player challenges as well as the mode where you can create any custom single-player session that you like! One of the products that you receive with this game, Gremlins, Inc., features both single-player and multiplayer modes, and requires that your game client is connected to both Steam and the game's server at all times – in order to support item drops, Steam Community Market and Steam Workshop. The other product that is included with the game, Gremlins vs Automatons, features single-player mode and is designed specifically to be played offline.\n\nAMSTERDAM AND SINGAPORE SERVERS\nThe game currently supports 2 separate servers: Amsterdam and Singapore. Players are able to check their ping value for each of these servers, and play on the server that is the most convenient. Each server has its own player ladder, statistics and player profiles. Most players choose Amsterdam, since ping to Amsterdam from anywhere in the world rarely exceeds 300. However, as we saw more and more players from the Asian region join the game, especially from China, we added the server in Singapore in order to be able to offer faster connection specifically to these players. We hope that this works well for every player, as good player experience is our top priority. We will continue to monitor the quality of our server/client connection in order to adapt the servers to the changing requirements and we thank you for your patience.",

A spot of light snatches from the darkness a small part, in which the little man can move. The space for movement is limited by a spot of light, but sometimes outside of this spot or on the border of light and darkness it is possible to move quite freely - for example, even to pass through walls or fall through floors / ceilings. Sometimes it is not enough to be in a spot of light or in darkness for movement. The path is sometimes blocked by various obstacles, or this path simply needs to be found, it is necessary to understand how and where you can move - the goal of the game is to find the final exit.\n\nAmong the puzzles are the search for various keys and ways to apply these keys, finding and moving light sources and other things. The game assumes that sooner or later the player will master the relationship with the light and will be able to use this understanding to achieve the ultimate goal.",

The game uses the Unity graphics engine and came out on three operating systems: Windows, OS X, and Linux. The game was originally supposed to be dedicated to the programming of nanobots, which are launched into the body of a living person, but the developer opted for a more appealing idea for a setting.\n\n###Key features\nThe plot tells a story about the player finding the faulty TIS-100 computer and the manual to it. TIS (Tessellated Intelligence System) is similar to the first computers from the 80s. Each level looks like a 12 program of nodes, located by a grid of 3 to 4. Each node has a processor register, behind which a certain numerical value is hidden. In order to solve the puzzle, the player needs to reprogram the node so that they perform specific actions using a simplified version of the real assembly language. In the version for Steam Early Access, which was released in 2015, 25 levels were available for the completion. Their number reached 50 at a full release. Only a single story campaign is available in the game. The players noted that the game is an excellent exercise for all programmers who want to compete with each other in optimizing the code in a fictional multithread assembler.",

It is the third game in the series and is a direct sequel to Skate 2.\n\n###Plot\nThe game takes place sometime later after the events of Skate 2. The main protagonist, who is now known as The Legend, became one of the best skaters. He travels to a coastal town of Port Carventer to take part in a sponsored event but fails. To get to the top again, he has to put up his own team.\n\n###Gameplay\nPort Carventer differs a lot from San Vanselona. There are no zones where skating is restricted. The city itself consists of three zones: The City, The University, and the Industrial Area. Each zone has its own differences, for example, there are a lot of monuments and concrete buildings in The City, while The University boasts a high number of open spaces.\n\nLike in previous installments, the game's core mechanic called Flick It is still present in the game and is essential for getting high scores. It gives the player control of the skater and maps it to the right stick of the gamepad. Players are given points for doing tricks. The amount of points depends on the difficulty of the trick and their combos. \n\nThe game offers three difficulty settings: Easy (you can jump higher and do tricks faster), Normal (a classic difficulty, like in previous games of the series), and Hardcore (the physics resembles the same of the real world). \n\nThere is an in-depth tutorial called Skate.school that is accessible at any point in the game.",

However, these tricks are not easy to master.\n\nHowever, Edge challenges your reflexes more than your ability to solve puzzles. The game usually gives direct hints about where to go and what to do to pass the level but it’s quite difficult to perform this safely.

Also note the unusual implementation of the dialogue tree: the developers sought to recreate lifelike conversations, each response changes the attitude of the NPCs to the main character.

    "description": "The game is a classic example of arcade racing shoot-em-up with a top-down camera. It tries to mimic Japanese bullet-hell games with a more casual approach. The player takes control of the buggy and joins La Resistance to prevent the Count Soap crimes and the use of stolen water. The buggy can be customized to your taste, using more than 35 upgrades.\n\nLike the plot, the gameplay in Pressure is designed primarily for kids. This is indicated by the casual complexity, an abundance of bright colors and a specific sense of humor. Add here a variety of weapons, upgrades, and enemies; the output will be an excellent timekiller for a couple of evenings. The game features several levels of difficulty, achievements and the ability to go through a story campaign from more than 30 cards together with a friend using the capabilities of a split-screen local coop. All results are published online.",

In Clash, two teams fight over territory control. In a round of Link, your objective will be to capture several control points before your enemy breaks the link between the points.

It originated in the 50s and exists primarily in the form of serials, rather than individual films.\n\nThe tokusatsu genre is characterized by a story about one or more heroes endowed with superpowers - technological or magical.\n\nA hero or heroes use their forces, ordinary and unusual, to battle with various evil forces — aliens, terrorists, monsters from the depths of the ocean, demons, and so on.\n\nBattles with enemies are abundantly present on the screen, filled with numerous special effects.\n\n###Plot\nThe game has a team of stunt actors who have ceased to like their work and they decide to create their own company that will shoot TV shows in the genre of tokusatsu.\n\n###Gameplay\nWhen the company is founded, the player must find the actors and conclude contracts with them. For each actor a separate contract is drawn up with special conditions, in accordance with their roles in the team.\n\nThe action in the game develops from episode to episode, each episode of the game corresponds to one episode of the series, which the company produces. And in the episodes of the series, the heroes fight with the villains, sometimes other characters adjoin the villains.\n\nThe series is shown on TV. He collects a certain audience, gaining (or not gaining) rating. Receipts in the company depend on these indicators. Money is needed for the company to maintain and develop activities.\n\nThe episodes are grouped into seasons, and if the company for one reason or another fails to finish the season, the game ends.",

    "description": "###Three in a row\nThe third part of the popular series of games in the genre three in a row, Bejeweled 3 was developed by the PopCap Games studio in 2010. The game was the fifth in the series, but the third one that received a number in the name. Originally released only on PC and Mac, but later it was ported to both consoles and mobile devices running Android, iOS, Java ME and Windows Phone. The developers called the game “the biggest Bejeweled experience available to date.” The game is available for free at partner sites.\n\n###What to do?\nThe goal of the game has not changed compared to the previous parts: the player must match three identical in color gem, which, if all is correct, they disappear. Rows of gems are constantly moving, and the game adds the random new gems on top screen. Thus, the player can launch a chain reaction and earn many points at once.\n\n###What’s new?\nIn the new part of Bejeweled, four new game modes appeared as well as new sound effects and improved graphics. However, this is true not for all versions of the game: so in the Java ME version, players have only four game modes available due to hardware limitations. There is Zen mode also in the game - a new one. There, players can customize the audio and visual components of the game and create their own meditative experience. There is no plot in the game, but you can earn 65 badges to prove the ultimate player’s skill.",

Source (2007). \n\n###Zombies\nThe game's portrayal of zombies was borrowed from John Romero's The Living Dead film series. This kind of zombies is faster, smarter, and very aggressive. They are easily attracted by the loud sounds, which makes use of firearms dangerous. The game also includes melee weapons for silent kills, but they are weaker. \n\nA unique feature in Contagion is that the dead players respawn not as humans but as an even stronger and faster type of a zombie. They join the other side and can help the AI-controlled undead.\n\n###Game modes\nThere are three main modes in Contagion and an additional Flatline mode. Hunted mode is competitive and pits the players against not only zombies but also each other in a classic deathmatch. The last survivor wins the game. This mode allows up to 16 players to participate.\n\nThe other two modes are cooperative and are only that allow the single-player walkthrough. Escape mode requires the players to survive together as a team of up to eight players. They enter a level and try to complete a series of quests while fighting off an AI-controlled zombie horde. Their main objective is to escape the level alive. Extraction is a stronghold-type mode. It tasks the players with searching the human NPCs on a map and protecting them from a wave of the undead.",

The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\nThis game was created using Clickteam Fusion!",

The game has a singleplayer mode, where players alone try to escape from the robots and do the same together with friends in the multiplayer mode. All actions are performed from the first person perspective.\n\nPlayers need to escape from Hunters, robots dressed like victorian-age gentlemen and their assistants: robodogs or worse. Robots must find and kill all players to get out of the island on which the action of the game unfolds. The landscape of the island is different during each playthrough - procedurally generated mechanics help to do so: the game engine chooses from five main themes - from the countryside to industrial areas.\n\nPlayers need to look for food and weapons to survive, besides, to spare parts for transport. The latter serves as the only way out of the island. Most of the game process is within the genre of stealth, so do not expect dazzling action from this game.",

The powers are not infinite, and Cole needs to be charged with more electricity. It depends on you if MacGrath will use them for the greater good or becomes a villain.

Rising Storm 2: Vietnam casts players into a brutal, authentic recreation of the Vietnam War.\nRising Storm 2: Vietnam offers intense tactical action for up to 64 players in battles between the US forces and the Vietnamese, with each force having their own unique abilities and tactical advantages such as Napalm Strikes, Artillery Barrages, surface-to-air missiles, traps, ambushes and more.\nA variety of authentic period weapons available including the M16, M14, M60, M79 and M3 Grease Gun for the Americans; and the Type 56 Assault Rifle (a Chinese copy of the famous AK-47), RPG-7, MAT-49, SKS Carbine and many, many more for the Vietcong.\nWeapons also have a wide range of functionality with in-game implications, including adjustable stocks, attachable bayonets, and a new and advanced recoil system which builds on the already phenomenal weapon handling that the Red Orchestra series is famous for.\n\nPlayers on the US team will be able to pilot 3 different helicopters - the UH-1H \"Huey\" transport, the OH-6 \"Loach\" light recon and the powerful AH-1G \"Cobra\" attack helicopter.\nPlay as both the United States Military and Vietnamese resistance fighters.

    "description": "Network multiplayer shooter from the first person (with the ability to change the camera into a third-person mode) - claiming the title of the fastest. The game is the continuation of the Tribes series.\n\nThe series includes games such as: Starsiege: Tribes, Tribes 2, Tribes: Aerial Assault, Tribes: Vengeance and Tribes: Ascend.\n\n###The general plot of the series\nThe plot of the series begins in 2471, when a scientist Solomon Petresun invents the first cybrid, a bio-cybernetic hybrid artificial intelligence named Prometheus. After this invention begins mass production of cybrids, which are intended to be used as slaves. However, in 2602 Prometheus grows and directs all cybrids against humanity.\n\n###Chronology series\nThe earliest events of this story occur in the game Tribes: Vengeance which was released in 2004.\nThe events of the next period are covered in the game Starsiege: Tribes, although the game itself came out before Tribes: Vengeance, in 1998. Then the story opens in Tribes 2, released in 2001.\nThe Tribes Aerial Assault, 2002 does not follow the events of the plot of the remaining games, although it is located within the general setting.\nFinally, the last game of the series today is Tribes: Ascend, released in 2012.\n\n###Terrain\nThe area in which the events unfold is very extensive. It consists mainly of hills, slopes and mountains. Anything else, such as buildings, is rare.\n\n###Player Classes\nAt the beginning of a match, each player chooses a character class. Classes are only three. Class can be changed during the game.\n\nLight class - health and weapons of this class are weak, but this class has a high speed, it can become invisible and attack at a great distance from the sniper rifle. He is the best if you need to steal a flag or catch up with those who have already done it.\n\nThe middle class is average in everything - in health, armament and mobility. But this is not only the average level of everything, it is also a good balance between all the qualities.\n\nHeavy class has the largest health reserve and powerful heavy weapons. Equally good in attack and defense, but moves slower than all, sluggish.\n\n###Special equipment and abilities\nAll three classes have a jetpack, allowing you to fly through the air. But the height of the climb depends on the chosen character class. All characters can slide on the surface, the speed of sliding is high, but depends on the mass of the character, and hence, on his class.\n\n###Modes\nTeam fight.\nCapture and retention.\nCapture the Flag, CtF is the main game mode. In this mode, tactics of behavior is of particular importance.\nCapture the Flag \"blitz\" (CtF Blitz) - the main difference from conventional CtF is that after each successful capture the enemy flag moves closer to the rear of its base.\nArena 5X5.",

Influenced by Max Payne, the game features the bullet time system which slows down the in-game passage of time that helps the players land much more precise shots. \n\nThe objective in the match of the game is to become the most stylish player with the highest number of style points. The style points are awarded for killing enemies while diving, doing flips, attempting slides and attempting such tricks. Slow-motion seconds are also awarded for stylish gameplay.\n\nThe game does not feature objective-driven matches, yet from time to time a special objective may be activated, such as Capture the Briefcase, Kill the Wanted One, Race to the Finish. Should a player complete the special objective, they are allowed to execute a special style move that acts as all the style moves combined. That adds a whole another layer to the gameplay.\n\nThere are nine weapons present in the game: two pistols, several SMGs, a shotgun, two rifles, your own fists, and a grenade. The pistols can be dual-wielded.",

The player assumes the role of Arkwright, a genius scientist who invented a new type of automaton called Fluro. The Fluros are amorphous creatures that can be made of any type of liquid and perform tasks for people. One day, the Fluros mutated and went out of control, ruining most of the world’s machines. Arkwright has to find the cause of the malfunction and restore control over the Fluros. \nThe gameplay consists of solving physics-based puzzles and manipulating the ridiculously complex machinery in a 2.5D environment. Arkwright jumps the platforms and pushes buttons to activate machines in a certain way. He can also use devices called Seeds to create new Fluros out of the liquids found on the levels, including lava. The Fluros, in turn, can be manipulated to perform helpful actions, such as to pull switches that are inaccessible for Arkwright. The liquid is the central element of the game, and a special graphics engine was made to animate it. The music by the famous DJ Jon Hopkins works as a hint for the player, becoming more complex when he or she does the right actions.",

Frank enters the city by helicopter, the helicopter pilot is told to return to Frank in 72 hours. Frank quickly finds himself in a shopping center, where a crowd of people are trying to hide from the zombies - as it turns out, it was zombies that caused the closure of the city.\n\nOver the next 72 hours (this time is one of the strict conditions of the game), Frank must survive, save a few people and understand where the zombies came from. Along the way, he fights with zombies, seeks solutions, makes weapons and takes photographs - he is still a photojournalist. For successful shots, he gets more experience, which is appreciated in the game.\n\n###Wheelchair with machine guns\nThe second game \"forgets\" about Frank, it features a motorcyclist Chuck Green, who arrives in Willamet after all has settled down. There is a drug against turning into a zombie now, it is expensive, but effective. However, the new invasion of the zombie is still happening, Chuck drives around the town on a wheelchair with a pair of rifles, shooting hordes of zombies and simultaneously showing a touching concern for his daughter, who is somewhere nearby and needs a cure for zombification.\n\n###Zombies give a second chance\nThe third game \"resurrects\" Frank, who after success in the first game managed to fall to the bottom of life. In search of a new chance to succeed, Frank returns to Willameth, who seems to have been cleared of zombies twice, but Frank is very lucky - zombies capture the city for the third time. This time there are more enemies, among them many new ones. There are also more types of weapons - those that you need to do yourself from improvised means. Frank will visit places in the city that he did not suspect. Especially impressive will be a visit to the amusement park - \"Uranus Zone\".",

Usually, Source Filmmaker is used in cases when the creators need to dynamically change the character's facial expressions or much more cinematic movement animations. \n\nThe capture process is fairly easy - the creators have to record the movement of each character present in the scene, record their animations, add camera movement, sounds, and only after that, it is possible to properly record the facial animations, change the lighting, and add special effects. All these things can be done directly throught Source Filmmaker without resorting to any other software.\n\nSource Filmmaker supports a wide range of cinematic special effects and post-processing filters. The creators can use any assets of Valve games that are made on Source free of charge. It is also possible to use the resources of the community-made Source mods that are published on Steam, or add their own ones directly into the Source Filmmaker.\n\n###Support\nValve puts a heavy emphasis on the educational value of Source Filmmaker, as the company helps out the animators, by publishing the source files for their videos, and holds the annual Saxxy Awards, where the most notable SFM works are given awards from Valve.",

After escaping from the laboratory, the main character returns back to their community only to find it in ruins and the whole population becoming drug addicts.

The licensing was provided to developers from FarSight Studios by Gottlieb, Alvin G. and Company, and Stern Pinball. In addition to a fairly straightforward development process, in parallel developers were negotiating the licensing of gaming tables. As a result, it was possible to negotiate for a certain period, and as of 2018, some types of gaming tables are not available for the game because the license was over. In total, more than sixty tables disappeared, most of which were included in paid DLCs.\n\n###Key features\nThe game came out on all possible platforms: including the most recent ones like Nintendo Switch, Sony PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. On the PC game is available for free, but for new tables, players have to pay. There is no plot in the game, and all the attention of the developers were focused on recreating all the smallest details of the gaming tables and the physics of the ball. The rest is a usual pinball: the player has access to the field and the ball, the main task is to beat out as many points as possible for three attempts, that is, without dropping the ball. You can catch it and toss it again with the help of two sticks that is the only player-controlled object in the entire playing field.",

No artificial constraints.\nCustomizable controls\nNVIDIA Game Ready Certified\nAbout the Game\nUnique fusion of a top down shooter and tower defense strategy. You are the X-Morph - an alien species that invades Earth to harvest its resources and terraform the surface. Strategize in the build mode by carefully selecting various types of alien towers or throw yourself right into heat of the battle. Build mazes for incoming enemies in an environment that provides exceptional planning freedom. Tear down buildings and collapse bridges to support your defense or to simply indulge in a spectacle of unprecedented destruction. Possess a range of unique alien weapons and use defense strategies like you've never seen before in this genre.\nYour goal is to defend the X-Morph harvesters from waves of incoming human forces. Each enemy wave is preceded by a setup phase in which the player can check what types of enemies are going to be attacking him and to observe their paths. There is no time limit for this phase, so the player can carefully plan his defenses or choose to start fighting immediately and place towers when needed during the battle. One of the game's key features is the ability to build towers virtually anywhere on the map and to shape enemy paths by connecting towers with laser fences. The player can choose between building long mazes out of basic towers or placing more advanced towers which are more effective at different types of incoming enemies. Advanced tower types specialize in dealing with specific enemy types e.g. flame towers are great for destroying fast moving ground units, artillery towers are best at countering large groups of slow enemies, anti air laser is ideal for shooting down heavy bombers.\nAs the X-Morph fighter you can engage enemy units directly with a diverse arsenal of weapons. You can morph into four distinct forms which specialize in dealing with different kinds of threats. Each form has a basic attack and a special charged attack mode. The Plasma Fighter is the most universal form - good at destroying both air and ground units. The Dark Matter Bomber is great at decimating groups of ground units. It can also slow down time and release a dark matter bomb that can cut down buildings. The Shredder fighter is perfect for annihilating large numbers of human air units and clearing the sky. Finally the Laser Destroyer is best for smelting large single units. It can also charge up a gravitational anomaly that sucks in smaller enemy units.  A large variety of weapons and enemies along with a dynamic, fully destructible environment provides a rich arcade shooter experience.\nThe game's environments are constructed with a lot of attention to detail and they are almost completely destructible. From small picket fences to huge skyscrapers. Any bridge or building in the game can be collapsed and it's destruction is dynamically simulated using realistic physics. The destruction is not only a visual effect as it can significantly influence the layout of the battlefield. The combination of dynamic environments, laser fences and real time calculated enemy paths creates unique gameplay scenarios.\nHumans are desperate to defend their home world. They have created huge, building size, mechanical war machines to fight against each other, but now they will use them to destroy the X-Morph. Each boss fight is unique and heavily influences the gameplay environment. Entire cities will be destroyed.\nX-Morph: Defence includes a split screen co-op mode. All missions have different gameplay scenarios designed specifically for co-op play. Enemies attack in larger numbers and from new directions making good cooperation essential to winning. In this mode the game can be played in many different ways, one player can focus on optimizing tower placement while the other shoots at enemies or they can both focus their firepower on the strongest attackers.",

The game is inspired by the particle physics and the wave-particle duality.\n\n###Style\nWaveform is set to the background of space, filled with stars and nebulas. Occasionally, a familiar planet such as Earth will appear in the background, indicating that we are traveling through the Solar system. The game is accompanied by the electronic ambient music score.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe wave of light under player's control has a shape of a sinus curve. It serves as a route for a particle that flies forward through space. On its way, it will encounter other photons of varying colors that the player has to collect to set a higher score. \n\nThe game has around 100 levels of varying difficulty. The player will encounter a number of level features that increase the complexity of the game as he or she progresses. The dark matter is an obstacle to avoid. Mirrors reflect the particle, making it bounce back on its way. Some obstacles may even eliminate the particle.\n\n###Controls\nThe player controls the wave with his or her mouse. Moving the mouse left or right changes the wavelength, while up and down movements influence the amplitude. The player has to adjust the wave to navigate the particle along the route. Increasing the amplitude will also speed up the particle as it moves up and down on the screen. Meanwhile, its horizontal speed stays the same, in full accordance with the Theory of relativity.",

The gameplay is a metaphorical representation of a visual programming language. The protagonist represents the processor register, and the player's instructions to the character stand in for the opcodes.\n\n###Premise\nThe main character is an office clerk who works in a storage department. His career lasts 40 years, each of them corresponding to an in-game puzzle. Two conveyor belts in the protagonist's office work as the input and the output devices, respectively. The input conveyor brings in the numbers and letters in the form of boxes. The protagonist is instructed to perform certain tasks and calculations with the boxes before sending them back through the output conveyor. The tasks usually require simple mathematical actions such as sorting and addition. The boxes remain stored on the office floor until the task is completed.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player controls the character using commands that remind the assembly language. The handwritten notes represent the instructions the player gives to the character. As the player progresses through the puzzles, the game introduces more complicated concepts and mechanics, such as memory addresses. This feature allows the player to order the character to perform operations in the certain place of the office. The goal of each level is to create a program. The game will test the results and inform the player if it works or not (through a supervisor character).",

    "description": "Doom (typeset as DOOM in official documents) is a 1993 science fiction horror-themed first-person shooter (FPS) video game by id Software. It is considered one of the most significant and influential titles in video game history, for having helped to pioneer the now-ubiquitous first-person shooter. The original game was divided into three nine-level episodes and was distributed via shareware and mail order. The Ultimate Doom, an updated release of the original game featuring a fourth episode, was released in 1995 and sold at retail.\n\nIn Doom, players assume the role of an unnamed space marine, who became popularly known as \"Doomguy\", fighting his way through hordes of invading demons from Hell. With one-third of the game (nine levels) distributed as shareware, Doom was played by an estimated 15–20 million people within two years of its release, popularizing both the business model of online distribution and the mode of gameplay, and spawning a gaming subculture. In addition to popularizing the first-person shooter genre, it pioneered immersive 3D graphics, networked multiplayer gaming, and support for customized additions and modifications via packaged files in a data archive known as \"WADs\". As a sign of its effect on the industry, first-person shooter games from the genre's boom in the 1990s, helped in no small part by the game's release, became known simply as \"Doom clones\". Its graphic violence, as well as satanic imagery, made Doom the subject of considerable controversy.\n\nThe Doom franchise was later continued with the follow-up Doom II: Hell on Earth (1994) and numerous expansion packs, including Master Levels for Doom II (1995), and Final Doom (1996). Originally released for MS-DOS, the games have been ported to numerous other platforms. Once the game's source code was released in 1997, it spawned even more adaptations, as fans further ported the code to countless devices. The series started to lose mainstream appeal as the technology of the Doom game engine was surpassed in the mid-1990s, although fans have continued making Wads, speedruns, and modifications to the original. The franchise again received popular attention in 2004 with the release of Doom 3, a retelling of the original game using id Tech 4, with an associated 2005 Doom motion picture. Another release, simply titled Doom and powered by id Tech 6, was released in 2016 and focused on returning to the fast-paced action of the first two games.",

The game first appeared on the public in 2009 on the developer's site and the Impulse site, and later appeared on Steam in version 2.0.\n\n###Interesting mix\nThe developers tried to combine in the game at once three genres: real-time strategy, tower defense, and 4X-strategy. Players and critics celebrated the unique gameplay but at the same time a fairly long process of learning the basics of the game. The main rivals of the players are two AI, the main goal - to destroy their planets. AI at the start has unfair advantages over the player, controlling the huge fleets of spacecraft. The game map usually consists of 10 to 120 star systems, its size greatly affects the game strategy necessary for victory.\n\n###Key features\nThe main feature of the game is the confrontation of players with artificial intelligence. According to the developers in AI War, this problem was solved: the local computer can think on three levels, adapt to the player's style of the opponent's game and surprise with illogical moves and attacks for the robot. DLC for the game, in addition to new units, maps and soundtrack, brought new types of artificial intelligence, victory over which becomes for players a kind of puzzle.",

There are also parkour elements: one climbs ledges, jumps onto wooden beams and uses ropes to travel around the levels.\nSubstantial attention is paid to the stealth mechanics. The protagonist can crawl behind the obstacles and take enemies down from a distance.  The Chronicles are in the way reminiscent to the original Prince of Persia series.\nThe game is composed of twelve episodes and takes place in China provinces like Na'an and Macau. \n\n###Plot\nThe game is the straight sequel of Assassin's Creed: Embers — the short film about Shao Jun — the disciple of Ezio Auditore who is the protagonist of the three previous Assassin's Creed chapters.  The setting is the XVI century China during the Ming Dynasty rule. After the training under the guidance of Ezio ended, Shao returned to China to fight the local Templar clan called  Eight Tigers.",

Reakktor Studios states that TOXIKK is what a typical multiplayer FPS would be if there were no MOBAs and military arcade shooters. There is no singleplayer campaign whatsoever present in the game.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game draws heavy inspiration from Quake and Unreal Tournament in its gameplay. It combines fluid and fast movement with lethal and accurate weapons. There are no loadout or class systems present in the game, just like in classic multiplayer shooters. Instead, the weapons spawned on the map with each player beginning with a simple pistol and a chainsaw, that serves as a replacement for a knife.\n\nSeven more weapons are present in the game: Dragoneer flamethrower, Violator assault rifle with an under-barrel grenade launcher, a shotgun, Stingray energy rifle, Falcon sniper rifle, Cerberus grenade launcher, and The Hellraiser, that one-shots any enemy. Each weapon has an alternate fire mode. For example, while using the alternate fire of a Stingray, a deadly energy beam is used instead of an energy sphere.\n\nThere are 13 maps present in the game, with one of them being a training map. Four modes are present in the game: usual Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Point Control, and Capture The Flag.",

The two siblings put their differences aside to team up against a new villain: a golem called Kax-Teh. Years ago, Ghat brought this creature with him to Zenozoik, and now the golem became too powerful for Ghat to tolerate.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game features an unusual combination of role-playing, fighting and beat 'em up elements.

The gameplay mostly consists of hand-to-hand fights, though the player can occasionally use weapons. Zeno Clash II has a unique combat system in which the amount of damage depends on which body part was hit. All battle movements cost stamina that has to be replenished. The RPG element allows the characters to improve their skills and abilities as they progress through the game.

A crew needs fighters to attack enemies, sailors to control the ship, a carpenter to fix it, and a cook to make food. \n\n###Genre\nWhile Pixel Piracy is more of a strategy, there are some features of the roguelike genre. The world is procedurally generated, and the crew will randomly encounter feral beasts and hostile pirates from other gangs. The player has to keep track of the ship's resources, otherwise, the crew might die of starvation or lose its morale.

It is possible to search for collectibles that are placed in secret areas around the game's levels. \n\nThe game pays tribute to numerous games. Most of these tributes are made during the game.

The game has a dynamic lighting system, so it will not work staying long in one place. Developers have added this system in order to speed up the game process: they do like stealth games, but don’t like their speed.\n\n###Key Features\nIn the singleplayer campaign, there are 80 levels in eight worlds, tons of puzzles and enemies. The player in the arsenal has nothing but a pair of night vision goggles, so you have to rely solely on stealth to make your way through the levels.

    "description": "Total War: ROME II - Emperor Edition is a strategy game developed by Creative Assembly. It is the eighth game in the Total War series and is both a sequel and a remaster to Rome: Total War.\n\n###Plot\nThe game does not feature a specific story mode, yet it offers a set of historical campaigns for the players to go through. Most of such campaigns revolve around the reign of Caesar and his military campaigns. \n\n###Gameplay\nIn Total War: ROME II, the players control armies of the Roman Empire era. It is completely up to the player how to form an army and its navy. \n\nThe formations of armies and navies have changeable stances on the game world's map. These stances define what distance can the army traverse in one turn and the time required for the troops to prepare an ambush. \n\nAt the beginning of each scenario, the players pick a faction to play as. Each faction has a specific amount of power called “Imperium.” It specifies how many armies can a faction have and can be gained by conquering nearby lands and getting gold. After forming an army, it is up to the player to assign a general to it. Upon doing that, the general will recruit the soldiers for his army. Both armies and generals can be leveled up which unlocks new skills and traits.\n\n###Emperor Edition features\nEmperor Edition was available as a bundle in retail stores. 22000 bundles were released. This edition features a unique box, playing dice, the map of Roman Empire, a map pack, and a Legendary Edition of the game.",

The protagonist awakes on a shore with no memory of the events leading him here. He goes to Fort Henry which appears to be completely abandoned. The whole colony is actually abandoned, yet there are hostile beings whose bodies consist of burning embers. The protagonist goes on to seek answers about what actually happened in the colony.\n\n###Gameplay\nBetrayer heavily relies on stealth in its gameplay. There are no clear paths or objective for the players to follow. This was made specifically to deprive the players of any sense of direction and encourage exploration of a monochrome game world. It is essential to listen to specific sounds in the game, as some of them will guide the players towards a clue or an important item. The clues are documented and put in your inventory upon picking them up. \n\nUpon encountering the enemies, the best strategy for the player is to hide in the high grass, spectate the enemy movement and pick the right moment to execute a stealth kill. Sound plays an important role here too, as any sound the players make in the grass will attract some unwanted attention, so it is essential to time your movement with the wind gusts. The players have access to a wide variety of weapons, such as pistols, muskets, tomahawks, and bows. Upon death, the players leave all their items at the place of death and can retrieve them.",

The heroes eventually die of old age, which makes them disposable. The player has to breed new heroes and build dynasties by arranging marriages. There are three main classes of heroes: Caberjacks (heavy warriors), Hunters (ranged archers), and Alchemists (similar to wizards).

Most missions involve a siege of a castle, with the player as the attacker, the defender, or both.\n\n###Economy\nEverything in Stronghold, from the food to the war, requires the player to establish a chain of production, such as a mill and a bakery to make bread. The player has to produce armor and weapons before hiring most types of units. There's also a reputation meter that tracks what the people think of their lord. The player can increase his or her reputation by offering the people more food, lowering taxes, or building pubs and churches.\n\n###Multiplayer\nStronghold Crusader II has several multiplayer modes.

The sniper wants the protagonist to complete quests around the town. These missions are quite humorous and include such tasks as fixing the town clock and shutting down a pornography store. Because of such humor the game with 2D cartoonish graphics is not allowed for kids. \n\nHector features point-and-click gameplay with a heavy focus on dialogues and less - on puzzle solving. Not all solutions in the game are obvious but, as a rule, you don’t have many items to use so variations of your actions are quite limited.

    "description": "This War of Mine is a game about civilians who are trying to survive during a military conflict. The game was inspired by the real-life Bosnian War.\n\n###Gameplay\nThis War of Mine is set in a fictional country Graznavia during an ethnic conflict similar to the siege of Sarajevo. The player controls a group of one to four characters caught in the middle of a war. Each protagonist has a unique set of abilities and weaknesses, some of which are hidden. Their goal is to simply stay alive. It requires them to scavenge food, meds, and other necessary supplies, keep their house warm during the winter and avoid the military. \n\nBy day, the city of Pogoren is filled with snipers who shoot at everyone indiscriminately. The player can explore the city only by night, though it is not safe either, as the characters can encounter hostile looters and marauders. Survival also requires crafting new items from the scavenged junk. One of the most useful items to build is the radio that allows the player to keep track of the events outside. To win the game, the characters have to survive until peacetime which may come at random times.\n\n###Expansion features\nThe Little Ones expansion pack allows the player to include a child in the group of survivors. It adds a new layer of complexity to the gameplay. The child is helpless and needs an adult to take care of him or her. However, the kid can eventually learn to perform simple tasks, such as cooking. To avoid depression, the child has to assemble new toys from the junk the adults have scavenged and meet other kids to play.",

The development of the game involved only one person - it's Benjamin River, and his take is similar to such games in the genre as Lone Survivor and Amnesia, only corrected for pixel graphics. \n\nThe main decisions in the game are made using a simple binary system: you just have to answer the questions with Yes / No. Based on the answers, the plot of the game develops, which narrates the mysterious murder. There are several unexpected twists in the plot based solely on the player's choices.\n\nThe game is very short and requires a lot of replays to fully understand its story - each time the player can experiment with the answers and get new answers from the game. However, you will not get all the answers - the game is not so elaborated. Home can create the right atmosphere, which, however, will not appeal to all fans of the genre: here you will have to read a lot and think through every answer.",

To do so, you must travel to various locations like gardens and fields. Each level consists of two parts. First, you have to find several items on the screen, such as eggs, flowers, parts of other insects. Then you solve a quick puzzle a get another list of items that you have to collect. \nThe gameplay itself, however, is not the focal point of Morphopolis, but rather a reason to explore unique environments.

The player controls Pac-Man through the maze where he must eat dots and avoid hostile ghosts. Besides dots, the player can collect bonus items that give additional points, and power pellets that allow Pac-Man to eat ghosts. Eating several ghosts in a row triggers a combo that gives the player a huge amount of extra points. \nThough the base gameplay is similar to that of the original arcade game, there are numerous new mechanics and gameplay differences in Championship Edition DX. The mazes consist of two halves. Eating all the dots on one of them makes a bonus item appear on the other half and eating an item makes a new dots layout appear on the other side. If a ghost is about to catch Pac-Man, a slow-motion effect kicks in giving the player an opportunity to avoid it. \nThere are three main game modes in the game: Score Attack, Time Attack, and Ghost Combo. The game features nine different courses and several visual style options. \n\n###DX+ version \nIn 2013, the game was renamed as PAC-MAN Championship Edition DX+ and received a free update. It featured an upgrade to the online component of the game and new paid downloadable content such as new skins and courses.",

The RPG element brings classes, skill trees, and looting system into the title. The available classes are warrior, mage, and thief.\nOne of the main focuses is on the realism — the game features a vast variety of deaths, for instance, death from frostbite if the character does not dress well; death from hunger in case the protagonist forgot to eat, and death from poisoning if the hero ate a suspicious flower in a middle of a woods.\nThe battles are not of the primary locus here — nonetheless, the system is simple and concentrated on hitting, casting spells and dodging in the appropriate time. \n\n###Plot\nThe player follows a storyline of a heroine who is destined to prevent Ragnarok — the death of all the living creatures according to the Norse mythology. The Valhalla stories, as well as the Tales of Nine Worlds here, are cleverly mixed-up with the postmodernist gags, forth wall-breaks, and even Harry Potter references. The game's source of inspiration is often confused with Skyrim. However, the developers say, that story resembles Quest for Glory in various ways.",

Gish can become amorphous to slip down the slopes and squeeze through the thinnest gaps and holes. He can stick to the walls, ceilings, and other surfaces to climb and hold on. Gish can also become a solid ball which allows him to push other objects from his way, break the obstacles and crush opponents with his weight. Puzzle-like level design often requires Gish to use a complex combination of his powers.\n\n###Style\nThe game is made in a simple and cartoonish visual style and has occasional glimpses of black humor. It is mostly set underground, in the dark tunnels and caverns. Gish is accompanied by a rock soundtrack that suits the game's quirky and creepy atmosphere.",

She is put in the Blackgate prison with the help of Batman. Two weeks later, the prisoners attempt an escape. The prison's staff is taken hostage, and the security detail is dead.

    "description": "Portal 2 Sixense Perceptual Pack is a standalone expansion pack for Portal 2 developed by Valve. It is mainly focused on the developers that are using the Intel Perceptual Computing SDK and a Senz3D depth camera. The camera is required to play the title.\n\nThe game features no plot whatsoever as it was developed as testing grounds for Intel's technology.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe core gameplay is the same as in the vanilla Portal 2 game. The players pass testing chambers using an Aperture Science Portal Device. This device creates two portals: blue and orange, which can be passed through by the players freely. The Portal Gun can also lift objects with its integrated gravity module.\n\nThe objective of the player is to reach the exit of the testing chamber by solving an environmental puzzle. For example, the door must be opened with a button that is triggered by a heavy crate. The players have to reach the crate first and somehow get in on the button for the door to open. \n\nWith each level, the difficulty of the environmental puzzles rises a bit with the addition of new elements and the increasing size of the chambers.\n\nThere are seven maps present in this map pack, specifically made for the use of the Senz3D camera.\n\n###Sixense technology\nSixense is a technology, that is developed by Intel. It allows the players to interact with the in-game objects using a special depth and gesture camera that is communicating with the game through a special API.",

    "description": "Heroes of Might and Magic III is a part of Might & Magic franchise and the third installment in its series. It is one of the most popular turn-based strategies ever created.\n\n###Plot\nThe game takes place in the fantasy world of Enroth. The story mode follows a large-scale war for the country of Erathia. Its queen Catherine defends her homeland from invading dark forces. The game's seven campaigns allow the player to participate in this war on various sides.\n\n###Gameplay\nAI and human players take turns, each turn representing an in-game day. Each player controls cities, heroes, and units. The default victory condition is to eliminate rival players by capturing their cities. The story mode, though, has missions with specific plot-related conditions.\n\nThere are eight types of cities. Each type has a set of units and a unique style, based on a fantasy culture such as elves, orcs, demons or the undead. Any player can conquer and control any city. A player who loses all his or her cities is eliminated.\n\nA hero leads an army of units. Heroes explore the map, capture resources, fight enemies and neutral monsters. As they gain experience, heroes level up and obtain new skills and spells. Each hero has eight unit slots. Units of the same type stack and act as a single, stronger unit. During combat, units take turns on a hexagonal grid. \n\n###HD Edition\nA new edition, released in 2015, includes slightly improved graphics redesigned for modern monitors and tablets. Otherwise, the game is identical to its original version.",

    "description": "Battlefield Bad Company is unique in the series \"Battlefield\" in that it features a full single-player campaign with characters. The previous titles were mostly focused on multiplayer with large numbers of players.\n\nThe game is retaining the vehicular and large-scale warfare but emphasizes squad-based combat.\n\n###The First Russo-American War and the private campaign of Bad Company\nSerdaristan, a small Caucasian country, became a place for a big war between Russia and the United States. First in Serdaristan, then in the Middle East, in the town of Sadiz on the coast of the Caspian Sea, the 222th Battalion, also known as the \"Bad Company\", puts itself under bullets. The name \"Bad Company\" is not accidental - the detachment consists of people who are best able to deliver problems.\n\nOne of the columns of the Bad Company was destroyed when it was sent to the battlefield. In investigating this case, the Bad Company's soldiers find out that they are not opposed by the Russian army, but mercenaries to whom Russia pays gold. Since then, the Bad Company has been fighting not only for the victory and glory of its country, but also for the sake of gold, which can be obtained in the pockets of defeated opponents.\n\n###The Newby and the Team\nPreston Marlowe is the main protagonist of the game. He just came to the Bad Company - just before the Bad Company found a new goal for itself - gold.\n\nSergeant Samuel D. Redford is the commander of the Bad Company and the only one who came there as a volunteer. He just likes to fight.\n\nGeorge Gordon Haggard, Jr. - has an explosive nature. And he knows everything about explosives.\nTerrence Sweetwater - smart ass.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player acts with one main weapon and another, used in the second turn. In addition to this, there are grenades, a knife and portable explosive devices. The player always has information about the number of remaining ammunition. If vehicles are not completely destroyed, they can be repaired any number of times. \n\nMilitary vehicles in the game are sufficient: infantry fighting vehicles, armored cars, tanks, attack helicopters, patrol boats, mobile anti-aircraft weapon system.\n\nFor the first time in the Battlefield games line, the Frostbite game engine is used - 90% of the environment can be destroyed. Destruction is subject to almost everything: trees, grass and bushes, vehicles, other players and even the ground itself. Lighting is adjusted for changes caused by destruction.\n\n###More and more\nGold Edition\nThe main feature of this edition is that it immediately makes available those types of weapons that are usually unlocked after reaching level 25.\n\nFind All Five\nThis addition allows you to unlock five types of weapons that are not available in the main game - the F2000 machine, the USAS-12 automatic shotgun, the M60 machine gun, the QBU-88 sniper rifle and the Uzi submachine gun with the silencer. For this purpose, special codes are given on the official website of the game.\n\nCommunity Choice Map Pack\nThis is a set of four new maps for the \"Conquest\" mode.\n\nBattlefield: Bad Company 2\nA direct sequel.",

Every machine has a limited amount of gas, can be damaged beyond any repair. The players can turn the differential lock on or off, activate the 4X4 mode, which will influence the amount of used gas. It is also possible to drag the car out of the mud by using a rope and attaching it to a tree or another car.\n\nThe players can also modify the cars using different attachments.

    "description": "Millennia ago, besieged by a Chaos invasion, a conclave of High Elf mages forged a vast, arcane vortex. Its purpose was to draw the Winds of Magic from the world as a sinkhole drains an ocean, and blast the Daemonic hordes back to the Realm of Chaos. Now the Great Vortex falters, and the world again stands at the brink of ruin.\nPowerful forces move to heal the maelstrom and avert catastrophe. Yet others seek to harness its terrible energies for their own bitter purpose. The race is on, and the very fate of the world will lie in the hands of the victor.\nPrince Tyrion, Defender of Ulthuan, guides the High Elves in their desperate efforts to stabilise the vortex as it roils above their home continent.\nAtop his palanquin-throne, the Slann Mage-Priest Mazdamundi directs his Lizardmen war-hosts as they surge northward from Lustria. He, too, is intent on preventing cataclysm, though the methods of The Old Ones must prevail.\nThe Witch King Malekith and his sadistic Dark Elf hordes spew forth from Naggaroth and their labyrinthine Black Arks. He tastes great weakness in the vortex – and great opportunity in its demise.\nMeanwhile a fourth, secretive race stirs, their motives obscured by sinister plots and machinations. The time for revelation is nigh…\nFour races, four outcomes, a single goal: control of the Great Vortex, for good or ill.\nAbout Total War™: WARHAMMER® II:\nThe second in a trilogy and sequel to the award-winning Total War: WARHAMMER, Total War: WARHAMMER II brings players a breathtaking new narrative campaign, set across the vast continents of Lustria, Ulthuan, Naggaroth and the Southlands. The Great Vortex Campaign builds pace to culminate in a definitive and climactic endgame, an experience unlike any other Total War title to date.\nPlaying as one of 8 Legendary Lords across 4 iconic races from the world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles, players must succeed in performing a series of powerful arcane rituals in order to stabilise or disrupt The Great Vortex, while foiling the progress of the other races. Each Legendary Lord has a unique geographical starting position, and each race offers a distinctive new playstyle with unique campaign mechanics, narrative, methods of war, armies, monsters, Lores of Magic, legendary characters, and staggering new battlefield bombardment abilities.\nShortly after launch, owners of both the original game and Total War™ WARHAMMER II will gain access to the colossal new combined campaign. Merging the landmasses of The Old World plus Naggaroth, Lustria, Ulthuan and the Southlands into a single epic map, players may embark on monumental campaigns as any owned Race from both titles.",

The new incarnation of the series was created on the Unreal Engine 3 for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC.\n\n###The general plot of the series - a brief overview\nAlien Breed: Impact\n\nTheodor J. Conrad is a mechanic on the Leopold spacecraft. In space, the ship is faced with a huge unknown ship, inhabited by hostile creatures. These creatures sneak aboard the Leopold and begin to destroy the crew.\n\nKonrad fights to save his life and the ship.\n\nHe is helped by the female android MIA, she gives advice, helps to find the right items.\n\nThe action takes place both on the \"Leopold\" and on a hostile ship.\n\nAlien Breed 2: Assault\n\nThe game begins where the history of the previous game ended. The hero of this game is the same Theodor J. Conrad, but his ship Leopold is already critically damaged and impossible to save.\n\nMIA is still trying to help Conrad, but becomes a victim of Klein - a man who managed to load his intellect into a computer that controls the alien ship. When trying to influence this computer, MIA fell under the influence of Klein's intellect and now cannot help Theodor.\n\nKlein tells Theodor that the ship was not really created by aliens, but by the inhabitants of Earth and is a huge scientific station, where earthlings explored alien beings.\n\nAlien Breed 3: Descent\n\nTheodor's situation becomes even more complex. Now the only one with whom Theodor can communicate is Klein's intellect, loaded into a computer. However, this is quite a developed \"creature\" that fully controls the ship, or rather, the scientific station, along with all the aliens on it. And this intelligence is able not only to control the aliens, but also to modify them.\n\nAs it turned out, Klein is able to send against Theodor his last ally MIA - MIA did not die, but turned into a fully manipulated Klein artificial intelligence, opposed to Theodor. However, Theodor manages to win over her and she even tells him how to defeat Klein. This is not easy, because Klein directs against Theodor all the systems of a huge ship.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe gameplay has common features in all three games of the series.\n\nAll games are shooters, the action of which takes place in the futuristic interiors of space ships.\n\nEach level contains several tasks, such as finding keys or restoring ship systems to work.\n\nBefore leaving the level, the player must complete all tasks.\n\nOpponents are aliens.\n\nInterestingly, you can save the game only in special places. The same places serve as shops where upgrades and other useful things can be purchased.\n\nInformation about opponents is revealed as the hero finds relevant sources of information in the game space.",

It is set in the cold, rainy area during autumn and winter.

The game itself recommends the player to replay it several times to discover all possible plotlines and endings.\n\nThe protagonist is Tom, a security guard at a secret facility. His only colleagues are Buck, an obese guard, and Eve, a young caretaker who is Tom's love interest. His mental health is far from perfect, as Tom suffers from narcolepsy. He often falls asleep and loses the edge between reality and fantasy. Some of the events in the game are actually the main character's illusions and dreams.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player leads Tom as he does his daily watchman's job. By night, he has to patrol the secret research facility, eventually learning its dark secrets. Occasionally, Tom will fall into his nightmares and have to run away from the shadowy enemies.

Completing specific tasks awards player with tarot-cards that give Belial special powers. \nThe Belial’s weaponry is different from that of Daniel through most of the weapons are similar in mechanics to their counterparts from the original game. Every weapon has at least two firing modes.

Each mechanic and every function that is considered a basic in an ordinary game here is hidden by an independent developer under the lock of additional content, which must be bought for the coins collected in the game. Perhaps the industry has gone too far in pursuit of profit and has forgotten what games are in the first place? The developer is trying to answer this question through the monotonous grind for abilities and power-ups.\n\n###Key features\nThe player takes control of the nameless protagonist, who must save the princess. The stereotypical story serves as the glue for a set of levels classics to the genre. The genre was selected suitably for such plot: DLC Quest is a 2D platformer.

The player chooses a character and participates in different activities throughout the festival. \r\n\r\n### Gameplay  \r\nIn contrast to previous Forza titles, the game lets players explore the area of the festival at their own pace. The game, however, keeps realistic physics system from previous games. There are dozens of various racing events scattered throughout the game world including point-to-point races, drift, races against planes and many more.

    "description": "The Howler is an indie puzzle platformer game developed by Antanas Marcelionis. \n\n###Plot\nThe plot of the game is based on the Lithuanian novel Hour of the Wolf. It is set in an alternate version of the 20th century Lithuania. The Alliance of Free Cities was created by the Rothschilds. Alchemists perform their research, and inventors fly their steampunk airships, mechanics create robotics. The story follows a former United States Marine Antanas Sidabras, who lives in the Free City Of Vilnius and investigates a murder. A major conspiracy comes up during his investigation.\n\n###Gameplay\nAntanas Marcelionis was the illustrator of Hour of the Wolf. The game inherits the same steampunk-induced visual style. The objective of the game is to fly your air balloon over multiple obstacles that will destroy it upon making contact. There are two ways of blowing the balloon. The players are able to either use their left mouse button to inflate the balloon or yell into the microphone if they have one (this is the default control scheme in the game). \n\nThe players can also control the wind flow with the arrow keys. The game's world is highly interactive, so it is possible to get more speed and elevation using chimneys and steam pipes. The game heavily relies on physics and wind simulation, as the players have to avoid sharp obstacles, mines, and all other sorts of hazards.\n\nTrailers:\nhttps://youtu.be/jolcjHcUDMM\nhttps://youtu.be/-29qlNLapgU",

The main objective of either team is to destroy the so-called Moneyball of the opposing team. In order to complete the objective, the players have to get through the turret defense, which can only be destroyed by sending out bots on a specific lane. Once the bots get to the turrets, their shield goes down, and the turrets can be destroyed.\n\nThe players are awarded money and experience for every kill they make. Experience is used to level the player's character up and unlock character-specific skills. The money can be used to summon new waves of bots or purchase temporary powerups at vending machines. \n\nThe game also features a survival mode called Super Blitz which puts five players against the in-game announcer. The players have to defend their Moneyball as the Announcer sents waves of bots to destroy it. The Announcer takes a break every ten rounds which can be used to repair turrets, build new ones or upgrade your character.",

    "description": "###The role model\nReleased in 2008, the game, is similar to another well-known representative of the genre of action-role-playing games God of War series. Developers became studio Liquid Entertainment, and the publisher company Codemasters. The game appeared on the PC and on the most popular consoles of its generation: Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.\n\n###The story and the setting\nThe plot of the game tells about Jason, and the action takes place in Ancient Greece. Like God of War, the game uses ancient Greek mythology to build a game universe. The modified myth of Jason and the Argonauts, who went on a journey for the Golden Fleece was used as inspiration. According to the scriptwriters of the game, Jason is a Greek king, whose wife was killed in front of him. The only way for a grieving husband to return the beloved is the Golden Fleece, which can resurrect the dead. Other well-known heroes of myths appear in the game: Hercules, Achilles, Medea, Medusa, Patroclus, and others. Together they travel through a variety of real and imaginary locations: Iolcu, Delphi, Mycenae, Tartar, and Kifr.\n\n###Key features\nThe game consists of a large number of dialogues and enemies confrontations on vast, detailed levels. In contrast to God of War, critics point out simple battles with bosses and the strange arrangement of enemies on each level, which also simplifies the gameplay. You can use a sword as a weapon, a spear, and a mace is also available. Each weapon has its own characteristics and offers different gameplay: the mace breaks shields, but can not cope with a large number of enemies, the sword reduces the player's defense capabilities, but increases the effectiveness of melee combat, etc. In addition to these weapons, you can upgrade Jason skills on four branches: Ares, Hermes, Apollo, and Athena. Points for upgrades the player receives as the tasks are completed and for the correct answers in the dialogs.",

He attempts to exit the house, but a mysterious voice from the phone screams insults at Anthony and tells him where to find the exit. Tony follows the clues and leaves the house.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe main gameplay mechanic is based on exploration. Like in most escape room games, it is necessary for the players to look for clues in the environment they are in at the moment. Further into the game, the levels are no longer set in a house, but in a park with the landscapes of it being used for several puzzles. \n\nFrom level to level, several gameplay mechanics change with the only gameplay element that stays the same is the character movement or item interaction. Everything else is subject to change. These gameplay elements can be used as a puzzle piece in several levels, but most of the time they create an obstacle for the player to pass.\n\nThe developers put a heavy emphasis on the fact that gameplay mechanics were meant to be experimental and unpredictable. This effect is achieved by avoiding the use of the “What you see is what you get” principle. There are multiple unexpected turns present in the game. For example, at some point of the game, the players have to jump down a ledge. It first it appears that the main character will fall to his sudden death, yet it appears to be the right direction to move to.",

    "description": "###Blast from the past\nA hit for mobile devices, released in the distant 2011 when the platform was just starting to move towards games. The game is an endless side-scrolling runner, the first time it appeared on devices running the iOS. Later the game was ported to other platforms, among which two unusual for the first decade of the twenty-first century: browsers in the form of the flash game and Sony Playstation Portable. The last game could be downloaded using the PlayStation Network. The game is often compared to another mobile hit of the era - the game Fruit Ninja, in which the player needs to cut fruits.\n\n###Key features\nThe game uses simple one-button control, for which the player can quickly adapt. Pressing the button raises the main character, and if the player releases the button, the protagonist falls. The game has a huge number of upgrades and a lot of enemies. Levels are full of obstacles, in order to get to the next, you need to fly a certain distance, after which the visual style of surroundings and enemies will change. The further you fly, the harder it is.\n\n###Continuous support\nDespite being released a long time ago, developers are still updating the game. The story tells about Barry Steakfries, who worked as a vendor in the gramophone manufacturer. The company eventually closed due to poor sales and the main character ended wandering the streets where he stumbles upon a jetpack. Dreaming of such a device in childhood, the main character does not hesitate to put it on and goes on the adventure.",

Unlike its predecessors, Europa Universalis III uses 3D graphics instead of 2D.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player chooses a country and administers its diplomacy, economy, military, and society. The game has an emphasis on development rather than war, and the combat system does not allow you to directly control the units. You can pick any time period from between 1453 and 1789 and any country from a roster of 300. Despite the series' title, civilizations are not limited to Europe. \n\nThe country's current leader and state of affairs are generated on the basis of real history. Once the player enters the game, however, the events are randomized and only depend on the player's actions. A new feature introduced in EU3 is that the player can hire up to three court advisors (EU’s equivalent to Civilization’s “great people”). Each advisor has his or her area of influence and helps to improve the empire’s science, culture, or army. \n\n###Expansion packs\nContrary to its name, Complete edition doesn't include all of EU3 expansion packs (it is Chronicles edition that does), but only two of them: Napoleon's Ambition and In Nomine. Napoleon's Ambition is set after the main game's timeline, lasts until 1821, and deals with the Napoleonic Wars. By contrast, In Nomine begins in 1399, and includes late medieval features like Byzantine Empire, Tamerlan's conquests, and the Hundred Years War.",

The game is set in a largely open 2D world, in which the protagonist can move in every direction. There's no side-scrolling, and each section of the world occupies exactly one screen. To help the player to distinguish them, the sections have names, often comical, such as \"Nice of you to drop in.\"\n\nAt the start of the game, the main character can only run and jump. After the player reaches a certain level, however, the game unlocks additional movements. The protagonist can eventually learn to bounce off the walls and perform double jumps. Nevertheless, the player cannot fight or otherwise defeat the monsters, such as bats and snakes he or she encounters. The only option is to avoid them. There are also collectibles like money bags, but they do not influence the gameplay. Their only role is to provide a 100% walkthrough achievement.\n\n###Style\nThe game features intentionally pixelated visuals to resemble an 80s arcade. It is accompanied by 8bit sound effects and occasional chiptune music. There's even an option to emulate a CRT display. The game uses a very limited amount of 8 colors, although the player can choose to switch to a 16-color palette or to change the default colors.",

It is the first title of the series with the second numerical part of the series a year afterward.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player is presented with the 2D world, which is filled with the ramps, cliffs, railings, and another environment to perform tricks on. As in many titles of its sort, the player gets bonuses for the number of stunts, safety landing and doing combos. The world consists of 50 levels: each one has 5 (250 overall) trophies, accomplishing every one of them unlocks the next level and so on. \n\n###Stylistics\nThe game features pixel-art graphics presuming the level design to be minimalistic. Such style, nevertheless, brings a unique trait to the game's mechanics. While it doesn't feature any of the usual skateboarding title's trampolines and pools, the minimalistic nature of the Olliolli brings the hardcore out and forces the one behind the controller to mash the buttons repeatedly, memorizing the playthrough during the entire level. Final parts of the game resemble the hardcore platformers like Super Meat Boy more than they resemble traditional skating games like Tony Hawk.\nThe title is also being praised for the soundtrack — it matches the indie stylistics and is available for sale separately.",

The players will encounter many obstacles in their way, find new allies and encounter powerful enemies.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game's creators put a heavy emphasis on how the game recreates the feel of old RPGs, such as Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy. The main feature of the game is the absence of death in a usual way. Upon death, the player's soul is sent to the Soul Giver in the underworld, where they can choose a new body. All the skills that the player has learned to the point of his death will stay unaffected. This makes possible the transition of the skills of one class to another which results in countless gameplay combinations and high replay value. It has to be noted that your equipment and potions do not carry over to a new character, just like in most roguelike games.\n\nThe game features a class system with four classes present: Warrior, Assassin, Mage, and Hunter. Each of the classes differs in gameplay and is chosen at the beginning of the game or upon death. A crafting system is also present in the game which allows for upgrading your hero's equipment on the go. It is possible to craft new armor and weapons, or healing potions.",

She is the only human student who was allowed to study at the institute run by the pigeons. She befriends several of her co-students and can become their romantic interest, despite being a member of another species.\n\n###Gameplay\nHatoful Boyfriend is a visual novel and therefore has minimal gameplay. The player interacts with the characters mostly by clicking on dialogue options. Some of the options require the main character to have certain stats. The game rewards multiple playthroughs by unlocking documents that reveal more of the game's world and plot.\n\n###Endings\nThe game has thirteen endings that depend on the choices made by the protagonist. After the player discovers the certain four endings, the Bad Boys Love mode is unlocked. This mode reinvents the plot with a horror twist. In this mode, the protagonist receives dark visions, and deeper explores the conflicted relationship between birds and humans.",

    "description": "Gear Up is an MMO-oriented vehicular combat game. The player creates a battle robot and challenges other players' robots to a fight in an arena. The game features arcade action and simple WASD controls as well as many customization options.\n\n###Modes\nThe game includes three multiplayer modes. The first two offer traditional deathmatches and team deathmatches for teams of up to eight players, typical for most online shooters. There's also a Conquest mode, which is an updated version of Capture the flag. In this mode, the teams compete over control of a radio antenna. There's also a single player mode in which the player can compete against the AI-controlled bots. This mode, however, is only meant as a practice, as the bots are very weak and predictable.\n\n###Customization\nCustomizing your robot is the main focus of Gear Up. Before entering a battle, the player decides what weapons and movement gear the robot will use. The player can equip his or her robot with legs or wheels, melee or ranged weapons, as well as skills like invisibility or wall climbing. The game offers a roster of 116 parts, however, because of the game's free-to-play model, some of them can only be unlocked by purchasing. \n\nThe improvements are not perfectly balanced, and there are the obviously superior combinations that most players prefer. For example, robots with melee weapons, such as a chainsaw, usually have little chances against their enemies equipped with firearms.",

It emits water-like energy that enhances the capabilities of the fighters. For most fighters, the story is standard. The exception is made for the anchor characters from both series: Ryu and Ken or Kazuya and Nina.

All characters from SF series are controlled by a six-button system, and for Tekken fighters, a standard four-button control is available. Players choose two characters: one from each universe. Fighters can be changed right during the battle. The game also features two new mechanics: the Gem System and Pandora Mode. Thanks to the first, the player can put up to three gems on the fighter that improve from the characteristics, and the second turns on when one of the fighters left less than 25% of health. In this case, this character can be sacrificed in favor of Pandora Mode, which enhances the remaining character strength and gives an infinite Cross Gauge.",

Its connection to the rest of the franchise comes down to the similar anime art-style and some characters and highly sexualized character design. Your goal is to defeat a never-ending string of enemies which the game calls the ‘Monsters Girls.’ They appear as explicitly dressed young women with some animal or mystic creatures features such as cat ears, dragon tails or owl wings. You fight Monster Girls primarily by clicking on them with the left mouse button. They do not attack you so you cannot die in the game. Killing enemies gives you gold coins. They are the main currency in the game. You spend gold to level up your character which increases your stats and makes you either deal more damage or hire the allies. The Allies are special characters that help you defeat enemies. Each of them has its scale of progression and comes with several passive abilities. These abelites can increase the amount of gold you get from each, the damage you deal with each click or improve automatic damage the deal themselves. The game is free-to-play and offers some paid DLCs in the form of costumes for your main hero. You can also customize your character’s outfit using gold coins.",

It is a remake of WiiWare title Rubik's Puzzle Galaxy: Rush. \n\n### Art-style  \nThe game’s art-style is very reminiscent of other Two Tribes title – Edge. It is extremely minimalistic. The levels themselves are mainly made of white cubes, and the other object is simplistic and colorful, and are mostly just geometrical shapes. \n\n### Gameplay  \nThe game consists of more than 70 levels. Your goal is to guide multicolored cubes to a certain spot on the level throughout the multi-layered levels; the game world is fully 3D.\nTo do so, you have to place individual tiles over the cubes’ course. They affect cubes’ direction and speed. There are also special tiles such as teleports. Each level has several entrance point and exits for the cubes of different colors. Some of them can have special objects like conveyor belts that affect cubes’ behavior. After the player places the tiles, they can press the button to start the movement of the cube. From this point, the player cannot affect them, and if any cubes collide or fall from the edge of the level, the stage restarts.\nThe main concern for the developers was the maximum simplification of the controls so the player can focus on the puzzles alone, so all the movements in the game may be performed with the sole mouse.",

Any touch to the \"enemies\", any falling or getting a bullet in the hero leads to instant death. The hero does not have spare “lives”, so you have to use the save game function.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game does not involve \"exploring the world\", you can move mainly forward.

This feature, combined with the requirement to complete the game as quickly as possible, creates one of the fascinating difficulties of the game.\n\nYou have to shoot not only at fixed objects, but also at moving objects. For example, there is a category of objects that fall from above, and you need to shoot them while they are flying - if you allow the collision of these objects with the ground, the player dies.\n\n###Indicators\nThe game evaluates the passage of the level of a three-point system, where three points means the passage with the maximum accuracy and maximum collected items.",

It is a stand-alone expansion pack to Men of War.\n\n###Story\nThere is no fictional plot present in the game. Instead, the players take part in real battles of World War II. \n\n###Gameplay\nThe game features multiple singleplayer campaigns for the U.S. Army, Vermacht, Great Britain, the USSR, and Japan. Nonetheless, the game does not focus on these campaigns much, as they are only used to introduce the players to the core mechanics of the game before allowing them to compete in the game's multiplayer mode.\n\nEach campaign consists of 5 missions, 3 of which focus on the assault on the positions of the enemy, with the next one revolving around holding your own ground and counter-attacking the enemy forces. In the last mission of any campaign, the players have to control a small squad that is sent out behind the enemy lines to sabotage the enemies' defense.\n\nDuring the game, the players take control of specific combat squads and armor, that can be called in by using the reinforcement points. These points are awarded to the player upon capturing and holding the control points. The capture of new positions allows for purchasing new vehicles and troop upgrades. The main objective of any singleplayer mission is to capture all the points on the map.\n\nMen of War: Assault Squad comes bundled with a map editor.",

    "description": "In Bad Rats, the player controls the rats that try to kill their prisoner, the cat, in a cruel and unusual manner.\n\n###Premise\nThe goal of the game is to kill the cat. Each level is a maze with rats on one side, and the imprisoned cat's cell on the other. An object like a bomb, a heavy safe or a chainsaw lies prepared next to the cat. The goal is to navigate anything across the maze to make the deadly object fall and kill the prisoner. The rats themselves can die a grisly death in the process, but as long as the cat is dead, the level is passed.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game is centered around creating physics-based contraptions with the resources given to the player. The rats cannot kill the cat directly, and they have to make a kind of Goldberg machines and test them before using them on the cat. They can use rockets, trampolines, bombs, and other devices. The player places his or her rats across the level, taking into account their roles and abilities. For example, there's a rat that beats objects with a baseball bat, a rat that fires itself from a cannon, and a heavy fat rat, among others. \n\n###Style\nBad Rats is infamous for its rude and overly simplistic visual style. It also became highly controversial and received a lot of criticism for its uncensored portrayal of bloody violence and gore. The game became a sort of a meme in the gaming community, and some claimed it was one of the worst games ever to be released on Steam.",
